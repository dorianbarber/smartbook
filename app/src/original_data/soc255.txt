Week 1: Obesity and sociological approaches to health


* Health defined-
   * World Health Organization
      * Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being
         * not merely the absence of disease or infirmity
   * Preventative vs. medical model
      * Medical Model
         * Absence of illness/disease
         * Prevalent model in US and industrialized nations
         * Skewed towards curative activities
            * More expensive 
               * Big pharma is expensive
               * Personalized medicine $$$
               * Band-aid; fixing the effects of disease without acknowledging the causes
            * US spends more money per capita than any other nation
      * Preventative Model
         * Focus is on preventing illness, rather than curing illness and disease
   * Morbidity and mortality
      * Morbidity
         * Illness (physical and mental)
         * Harder to measure accurately
         * CDC and National Center for Health Statistics collect surveys
            * Immigrants might have illness but aren’t aware
      * Mortality = death
         * Easier to define and measure
            * Exception of immigrant groups
         * Recorded on death certificates
         * Salmon bias hypothesis
            * Immigrants try to return home to die in their home country
               * Undercount deaths of immigrants
         * Changes in US mortality
            * Leading causes of death in 1900:
               * Infectious diseases
                  * pneumonia/flu, Tuberculosis, diarrhea/diphtheria
               * Prevented with improvements in public health
            * Leading causes of disease now:
               * Social environment-influenced lifestyle causing diseases        
                  * Cancer
                  * Heart disease
                  * Chronic lower respiratory diseases
* Sociology and health
   * Sociologists study health bc:
      * Unequal outcomes
         * Health is not evenly distributed in society
      * Tied to social environment
         * Lifestyle is affected by social environment
            * Rooted in social causes
            * Health is not individual; it is a societal problem
      * Health is ultimate indicator of inequality
         * mortality decreases by income
      * Does not dismiss biology and genetics
   * Sociology approaches vs others-
      * Sociologists- 
         * Focus on fundamental factors distant from outcome (social class, gender) 
            * Fundamental causes
      * Epidemiologists
         * Focus on more proximal factors (diet, exercise, smoking)
      * Medical doctors
         * Focus on biological factors (cholesterol levels)
* Tension between goals of for-profit organizations (food and pharma industries) and the ability and desire for govt regulation of public health


* Obesity
   * Defined by body mass index (30-40)
      * BMI = Weight (kg)/height (m2)
   * Worldwide burden
      * 44% increase in 6 years (2009-2015)
      * 118% increase in 20 years (2015-2030)
   * Linked to hypertension, diabetes, heart diseasel, metabolic syndrome, poor mental health, and high $$$$$$$$
   * Perceived as individual problems
      * 80% of overweight kids become overweight adults
         * Socialized early and its hard to change
      * In US span of 25 years (1990-2015)
         * Maximum in each state is 14%, now 0 states under 20%
      * 1980 to 2014 obesity rates-
         * Age 2-5 (5 - 9.4%)
         * Age 6-11 (6.5 - 17.4%)
         * Age 12-19  (5 - 20.6%)
   * US aging population growing
      * 2000- 12%, 2070 projected 25%
         * Fat children going forward
   * What contributes to growing obesity
      * Unhealthy foods are cheaper; healthy is expensive
         * 190% increase in prices for fresh fruits and veggies
         * Food prices dropped by 38% since 1978
      * Easier to live a sedentary lifestyle
      * Massive economic changes
         * Women in the workforce; longer commutes
            * No one is at home to prepare healthy meals or socialize kids
            * 1976- 31% labor force moms,  2012- 62% labor force mom
      * Changes in social and cultural norms
         * Fast food culture; Sundays in the south        
            * 48% of americans say they drink at least one glass of soda daily
            * 2015, avg american drinks 60 gallons of soft drinks
               * 50% increase from 1980
      * Changes in the food and marketing
         * Targeting children, different ingredients
   * Food industry- 35 billion for advertising
      * 70% advertising for non nutritious foods
      * 2% fruits, veggies, grains
         * Heavily marketed to kids
   * Children’s Food and Beverage Advertisement Initiative
      * Voluntary industry self regulatory program
         * 18 participating companies in 2016
   * Obesity epidemic worsening
      * Governmental efforts to stop it have been unsuccessful
      * Industry self regulation problematic


* Opioid
   * Late 1990s, pharma encouraged doctors to prescribe opioid pain relievers
         * Said not addictive
         * Heavy marketing with promo videos
      * Doctors prescribed medications and discovered addictive nature
   * 2015, 2 million people had substance use disorders related to Rx opioids
      * 33000+ (over half) deaths tied to opioid overdose
      * 591,000 had heroin disorder
   * Opioid as gateway to heroin
      * 21-29% patients given opioid Rx misuse them
      * 4-6% who misuse prescription opioids transition to heroin
      * 75% heroin users first misused Rx opioids
   * Invisible forces
      * Big pharma makes 9.57b profit off opioid painkillers
      * Physicians get food, beverages, travel and lodging for opioid product payment
   * Caused by economic recession

   * Forced migrants
      * Asylum seekers- already in country and apply for residence
         * Somehow got here legally and show that if they go back = persecution
      * Refugees- applying for residence outside of country
         * 85k/675k is refugees
   * Undocumented migrants
      * Not always distinct from #1
         * Can get here legally but overstay visas

      * ~50% from Mexico
         * Concentrated in California, Texas, Florida, New York
            * Gateway states with need for migrant workers and agriculture
* Is a result of factors and policies in the sending countries and countries of reception
* History of US immigration
   * Colonial period: 1600s-1776; northern Europe
   * Mid and late 19th century; northern Europe
      * 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act banned new laborers for 10 years and denied path to citizenship leaving thousands unemployed
         * Additional laws restricted Asian immigration
   * 1921 and 1924 Immigration Acts (national origin quotas)
      * Limited total number of immigrants entering each yearto 350k (165k in 1924) and capped nationality quota at 3% from any country

      * Limited protection for immigrants
* Social status in origin and arrival
   * Social status= fundamental cause of disease (Link and Phelan)
   * Three characteristics
      * Involves access to resources that can be used to avoid risk or minimize the effects of disease
      * Influences multiple risk factors and multiple disease outcomes
      * Maintains an association even when intervening mechanisms change
   * race/ethnicity is a fundamental social status


Week 3: Explanations for immigrant health


* Health is just one of many assimilation outcomes
* Three key factors determine degree and ease of assimilation
   * Individual traits 
      * education, income, skills, language
   * Social environment in sending and receiving country
      * Government policies 
         * exclusion, acceptance, encouragement
      * Attitude of native-born population 
         * Discrimination
      * Presence of co-ethnics
   * Family structure
      * Unpaid female labor towards “family” businesses
      * More resources for economic attainment
* What do we know about immigrant health?
   * Populations from diverse world regions
   * On average, they arrive healthier than US born
      * Selective migration
      * Cultural buffering (having social support network)
      * Lifestyle and diet 
   * On average, they lose health advantage over time
      * Stressful experience (discrimination)
      * Regression towards mean/average
         * Health doesn’t decrease that much
      * Increasing risk taking factors
      * Loss of protective factors
   * Patterns vary across groups
* Other explanations for why immigrants appear to lose their health over time
   * Problems with research questions
      * Morbidity (cultural biases in self-reports)
         * Questions don’t translate as well
      * Mortality (salmon hypothesis)
         * Elderly people go home to die
   * Cross sectional data
      * Access to care increases with time
      * Newer immigrants may not have access at first (not aware of questions)
      * Reference group changes over time
         * Compare yourself to people around you over time (relative to proximity)
      * Not necessarily Americanization


Week 4: Hispanic immigrants


* Hispanic Americans        
   * Who is classified as Hispanic?
      * Person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race
         * 17.6% or 55m Hispanic
         * 63% of that Mexican (32m)
      * In 2015, 1 in 5 people in US hispanic
      * In 2045, 1 in 4 people 
         * But not all immigrants!
      * 64% of 32 million Mexican immigrants are US born
         * 36% are foreign born but only half are undocumented
            * 6 million legal, 5.6 illegal
   * Mexico and US immigration policies
      * Hispanic Paradox- (esp. Mexican)
         * Lower socioeconomic status but better health outcomes
      * Bracero Program (1942-1964)
         * Manual laborer worker program that paid 30c/hour
      * 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act
         * Imposed numerical limits on Mexican immigrants
            * Family reunification favored larger groups of people that allowed them to grow more
      * IRCA (1986)
         * Toughened border security and increased penalties
            * Gave legal status to immigrants already in country
* Hispanics have high employment rates but:
   * Not necessarily highly skilled
      * Low pay, intensive (domestic housekeeping, farming, construction, landscaping)
   * Low english proficiency
      * Jobs don’t require english so illiteracy is perpetuated
   * Low educational attainment
   * Low social class status
   * High rates of poverty
* Poverty
   * Pre-tax income; does not vary geographically
   * In 2015, 13.2% of Americans (43.1m)
         * 9% white, 24% black, 21% hispanic
         * Sheer numbers- whites using most of the poverty benefits but minorities disproportionately represented
      * Single person, $12k is poverty line
         * 11k if over 65 years old
      * Single parent with 1 kid, $16,337
         * 57% of their income would be needed for childcare
      * Single parent with 2 kids, $19,096
         * Will not get you housing, healthcare or childcare
   * Wealth inequality bigger problem than income inequality and is growing
      * Home, stocks and bonds, boats → all assets
      * People marry each other and combine assets
         * For every 1 dollar of wealth that whites have 
            * Asians have 81 cents
            * Blacks have 6 cents
            * Hispanics have 7 cents
* Mechanisms linking low status to health - stress
   * Worse economic conditions

   * Vulnerable to effects espec if ur poor
* How does stress get “in” the body?
   * Cortisol and epinephrine/adrenaline have both protective and damaging effects on body
   * Four conditions leading to allostatic load
      * Repeated frequency of stress responses to multiple novel stressors
         * New stressors that can’t be habituated to and can’t be expected
      * Failure to habituate to repeated stressors of the same kind
         * Increase in blood pressure
      * Failure to turn off stress response in a timely manner due to delayed shut down
      * Inadequate response that leads to compensatory hyperactivity of other mediators
* Immigrants bring characteristics that then impact their health profile
* Arrival cohort
   * If they start off being bad, they get worse


Week 5: Black Immigrants, Racism and Health


* Evidence of black/white health disparities        
   * Not just about immigrants
   * Disparities across life course (death and birth)
* Major explanations for disparities
   * Genetics
   * Social position
   * Discrimination and racism
* Role of stress
   * Applicability to black immigrants


Black white differences in mortality and morbidity stable despite rapid advances in technology,
* Gap between black and white health has stayed stable despite standard of living going up
* US born black Americans have
   * Shorter life expectancies
   * Higher disability rates
   * Higher rates of many chronic diseases
   * Less access to health care


In general, women outlive men, black male life expectancy playing catch up to white females
* 2016 black male still LOWER than 1970 white female
Infant mortality- indicator of overall development of country
* If you can’t keep kids alive at birth (infant mortality up to first year)
   * Indicative of overall economic prosperity
* 40 weeks is full-term gestational period (10 months)
   * Premature birth is less than 37 weeks gestation
* Low-birth weight (LBW) for singleton/single infant- below 5.5 lbs (2500 grams)


Predict with premature birth and low birth weight
* Infant mortality
* In childhood linked to
   * Cognitive delay
   * Psychomotor problems
   * Subnormal growth
   * Language delay
   * School failure
* Adulthood linked to
   * Cancer 
   * Cardiovascular conditions
   * Diabetes
   * Arthritis
      * Long arm of childhood- if born prematurely or at LBW, higher likelihood for cancers, etc (long-term consequences)


LBW birth weight predicts:
* Adult obesity
   * Nutritionally deprived newborns are programmed to eat more because they develop less neurons in region of brain that controls food intake


Black infant mortality is at least consistently double whites
* Gap has grown
   * 1960- blacks 44.3, whites 22.9
   * 2016- blacks 11.1, whites 4.8


Black immigrants are continuing to contribute to black population, especially as their numbers grow


Explanations for racial disparities
* Genetics largely discounted
   * Genetic human variation between populations is modest 
      * If its genetic gene, African gene should be strongest for women born in Africa
      * But African born look most like US white women
* Social position
   * Buffers against stress
* Discrimination and racism
   * Better at measuring this 


Discrimination- process by which members of a group are treated differently on the basis of belonging to that group
* Two types
   * De jure- in law
      * Jim Crow laws, institutionalized racism
   * De facto- in reality
      * Colorblind racism, neighborhoods that result in school segregation


Everyday discrimination scale by David R Williams
* Experiencing discirmination triggers feelings of being
   * Over scrutinized
   * Overlooked 
   * Underappreciated
   * Misunderstood
   * Disrespected
* Violate cultural expectations of fairness, morality , dignity and human rights
* Elevated stress accumulates over time= poor health outcomes
   * Create stress through allostatic load
   * In 2015, 23% of blacks said they experienced discrimination at least once a week


How stress impacts health: allostatic load
* Repeated frequency of stress responses to multiple novel stressors
* Failure to habituate to repeated stressors of the same kind
* Failure to turn off each stress response in timely manner due to delayed shut down
* Inadequate response that leads to compensatory hyperactivity of other mediators
Allostatis- ability to maintain stability through change


Need to understand how immigrants are contributing to health profile of US


Importance of black immigrants for US racial disparities
* Tripled in size 3% to 9% of black population since 1980
* Projected to be 16.5% of black population in 2060


Why do black immigrants matter?
* From diverse origins
   * 50% from Caribbean (Jamaica, haiti)
   * 39% from Africa
* On diverse visas
   * Immigrants coming in on diversity visas are pre-selected (probably have good health)
   * Refugees - low health
   * Translates into diverse health outcomes
* Share same status as black Americans but have significantly better health
   * 2nd generation do poorly on many outcomes
* Mary Water’s research on Caribbean immigrants in NYC [Black Identities]
   * More likely to work, work more hours, have higher incomes than US born blacks
   * Immigrants come from societies where not the racial minority often with accents allows them to be perceived differently
   * But over time, advantages erode
      * Without accents and raised in US context, 2nd gen look the same as US blacks
   * Advantages parents bring with them wash away in new racial context of origin for their children


Read and Emerson Application to Health research questions
* Is the black immigrant health advantage uniform across groups or does it vary by region of birth
   * Need to disaggregate the foreign born
* Is their advantage due to selectivity, culture, socioeconomic status, or other factors like racism


Racial context of origin- experience of being a racial minority or majority


If you are perceived as being a racial minority your entire life, you become stressed very early on
* Weathering- constant pressure of being a minority, slowly grinds you down


Region of origin affects health through
* Exposure to stressful life events (discrimination)
* Position in stratification system (social position)
* Racial identity formation
   * Seeing people in positions of power that don’t look like you
   * Not seeing yourself represented in media
* Reference group
   * For US born blacks, the reference is average US citizen
   * For immigrant blacks, the reference location is region of origin

KNOW LINK AND PHELAN
* 3 CHARACTERISTICS OF FUNDAMENTAL CAUSE
   * How does being an immigrant relate




Social class- fundamental cause of disease
* Involves access to resources that can be used to avoid risk or minimize effects of disease
   * Safe neighborhoods, good health insurance
