lostatic load
      * Repeated frequency of stress responses to multiple novel stressors
         * New stressors that can’t be habituated to and can’t be expected
      * Failure to habituate to repeated stressors of the same kind
         * Increase in blood pressure
      * Failure to turn off stress response in a timely manner due to delayed shut down
      * Inadequate response that leads to compensatory hyperactivity of other mediators
* Immigrants bring characteristics that then impact their health profile
* Arrival cohort
   * If they start off being bad, they get worse


Week 5: Black Immigrants, Racism and Health


* Evidence of black/white health disparities        
   * Not just about immigrants
   * Disparities across life course (death and birth)
* Major explanations for disparities
   * Genetics
   * Social position
   * Discrimination and racism
* Role of stress
   * Applicability to black immigrants


Black white differences in mortality and morbidity stable despite rapid advances in technology,
* Gap between black and white health has stayed stable despite standard of living going up
* US born black Americans have
   * Shorter life expectancies
   * Higher disability rates
   * Higher rates of many chronic diseases
   * Less access to health care


In general, women outlive men, black male life expectancy playing catch up to white females
* 2016 black male still LOWER than 1970 white female
Infant mortality- indicator of overall development of country
* If you can’t keep kids alive at birth (infant mortality up to first year)
   * Indicative of overall economic prosperity
* 40 weeks is full-term gestational period (10 months)
   * Premature birth is less than 37 weeks gestation
* Low-birth weight (LBW) for singleton/single infant- below 5.5 lbs (2500 grams)


Predict with premature birth and low birth weight
* Infant mortality
* In childhood linked to
   * Cognitive delay
   * Psychomotor problems
   * Subnormal growth
   * Language delay
   * School failure
* Adulthood linked to
   * Cancer 
   * Cardiovascular conditions
   * Diabetes
   * Arthritis
      * Long arm of childhood- if born prematurely or at LBW, higher likelihood for cancers, etc (long-term consequences)


LBW birth weight predicts:
* Adult obesity
   * Nutritionally deprived newborns are programmed to eat more because they develop less neurons in region of brain that controls food intake
