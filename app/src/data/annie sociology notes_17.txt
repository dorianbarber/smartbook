Maintains an association even when intervening mechanisms change (ex: changing someone’s neighborhood won’t improve health outcome bc it’s not fundamental) --how it relates to immigrants (hispanic and black) Patterns in immigrant health on arrival and over time? --Explanations for patterns on arrival and over time (mechanisms) --shortcomings in explanations? What do we know about Hispanic immigrants? --size and major national origins --size of undocumented population What do we know about black immigrants? --Evidence of black/white disparities (not just immigrants) --explanations for racial disparities --size and major national origins of immigrants --Why they matter for US health disparities 1.
