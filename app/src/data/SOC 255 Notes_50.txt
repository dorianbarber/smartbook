older adults since both the likelihood of emigrating from Mexico, and that of returning to Mexico vary with age * young working-age adults whose reasons for migrating are usually financial and likely quite different from those of older adults, who may migrate to accompany family members; therefore, results from studies on older adults may not be generalizable to younger migrants * this finding corroborates previous research suggesting that acculturation has deleterious effects on immigrant health * this studyâ€™s findings provided support for both a healthy migrant effect and salmon-bias for activity limitation, but these selection effects did not appear relevant in self-rated health or chronic conditions * plausible explanation is that having an activity limitation hinders migration to the United States among those in Mexico, but encourages Mexicans in the U.S. to re-emigrate back to Mexico * migrants are positively selected in some health aspects, negatively selected in others, and
