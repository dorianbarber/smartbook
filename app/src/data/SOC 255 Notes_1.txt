The Prescription Opioid and Heroin Crisis: A Public Health Approach to an Epidemic of Addiction by Kolodny 


* Abstract
   * overprescribing of OPRs has led to a sharp increase in the prevalence of opioid addiction, which in turn has been associated with a rise in overdose deaths and heroin use
* Intro
   * addiction is defined as continued use of a drug despite negative consequences 
   * 4 out of 5 current heroin users report that their opioid use began with OPRs
   * appear to be switching to heroin after becoming addicted to OPRs because heroin is less expensive on the black market
* History of the Opioid Addiction in the US
   * main source of the epidemic was iatrogenic morphine addiction, which coincided with the spread of hypodermic medication during 1870–1895
   * nineteenth-century physicians addicted patients—and, not infrequently, themselves—because they had few alternatives to symptomatic treatment
   * revolutions in bacteriology and public health, prescription laws; and admonitions about morphine in the lay and professional literature stemmed the addiction tide
   * after World War II, these epidemics disproportionately affected inner-city minority populations,
* The Sharp Rise in Prescription Opioid Consumption
   * 1986 a paper describing the treatment of 38 chronic pain patients concluded that OPRs could be prescribed safely on a long-term basis
   * acceleration was fueled in large part by the introduction in 1995 of OxyContin, an extended release formulation of oxycodone manufactured by Purdue Pharma
   * prior to the introduction of OxyContin, many physicians were reluctant to prescribe OPRs, but told addiction was less than 1%
      * long-term clinical trials demonstrating the safety and efficacy of OPRs for chronic non-cancer pain have never been conducted
* Reframing the Opioid Crisis As An Epidemic of Addiction
   * evidence suggest that addiction occurring in both medical and nonmedical users, rather than abuse per se, is a key driver of opioid-related morbidity and mortality in medical and nonmedical OPR users
* Opioid Harms Are Not Limited to Nonmedical Users
   * policy makers who focus solely on reducing nonmedical use are failing to appreciate the high opioid-related morbidity and mortality in pain patients receiving OPR prescriptions for medical purposes
   * opioid overdoses appear to occur more frequently in medical OPR users than in young nonmedical users
   * middle-aged women and the elderly are more likely than other groups to visit doctors with complaints of pain
      * white women ages 55–64 have also experienced the largest increase in accidental opioid overdose deaths
* Opioid Addiction is a Key Driver of Morbidity and Mortality
   * accidental opioid overdose is a common cause of death in individuals suffering from opioid addiction 
   * sharp increase in the prevalence of opioid addiction is a key driver of opioid-related morbidity and mortality
* Prevention Strategies
   * interventions should focus on:
   * primary: preventing new cases of opioid addiction
   * secondary prevention: identifying early cases of opioid addiction 
   * tertiary prevention: ensuring access to effective addiction treatment 
* Primary Prevention
   * aim of primary prevention is to reduce the incidence of a disease or condition
   * opioid use disorders appear to be highly prevalent in chronic pain patients treated with OPRs
   * Preventing Addiction Caused by Medical Exposure to OPRS
      * to reduce the incidence of iatrogenic opioid addiction, health care professionals must prescribe opioids more cautiously for both acute and chronic pain
      * OPR prescribing for chronic non-cancer pain increased over the past decade while use of nonopioid analgesics decreased
         * pattern highlights the need for prescriber education that explicitly corrects misperceptions about OPR safety and efficacy
      * providing prescribers with accurate information about opioid risks and benefits could result in more informed risk/benefit appraisals
      * some opioid manufacturers have reformulated OPRs to make them more difficult to misuse through an intranasal or injection route
      * these so-called abuse-deterrent formulations (ADFs) may offer safety advantages over easily snorted and injected OPRs, but they do not render them less addictive
   * Preventing Addiction Caused by Non-Medical Exposure to OPRS
      * adolescents and young adults who experiment with nonmedical use are most likely to obtain OPRs for free from friends or family members who had received a legitimate prescription
      * unused OPRs in medicine chests should be immediately discarded or returned to a pharmacy
      * Individuals who perceive the risk of non-medical OPR use to be low may be more likely to misuse OPRs
      * social marketing campaigns designed to increase perceived harmfulness of OPRs may be an effective prevention strategy
* Secondary Prevention
   * aim of secondary prevention is to screen for a health condition after its onset but before it causes serious complications
   * difficulty of diagnosing opioid addiction in individuals motivated to conceal their condition suggests that prescribers should seek collateral information before prescribing OPRs
   * urine toxicology cannot determine if a patient is taking extra doses or if a patient is using OPRs by an intranasal or injection route
   * doctor shopping: opioid-addicted individuals may receive OPR prescriptions from multiple providers
      * doctor shoppers can be identified through use of state prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs)
   * some doctor shoppers turned away
      * efforts must be made to help these clinicians understand that drug-seeking patients are suffering from the chronic, life-threatening disease of opioid addiction
* Tertiary Prevention
   * strategies involve both therapeutic and rehabilitative measures once a disease is firmly established
   * ensuring that opioid addicted individuals can access effective and affordable opioid addiction treatment.
   * Opioid Addiction Treatment
      * treatment of opioid addiction includes pharmacotherapies and psychosocial approaches, including residential treatment, mutual-help programs
      * psychosocial opioid addiction treatment approaches show value and are an important treatment option 
   * Harm-Reduction Approaches
      * tertiary prevention strategies also include harm-reduction approaches to improving health outcomes and reducing overdose deaths
      * 1990s, syringe exchange programs began distributing naloxone to injection drug users for the purpose of rescuing peers
* Conclusion
   * efforts must be made to reduce the incidence of opioid addiction, identify cases early, and ensure access to effective treatment.
