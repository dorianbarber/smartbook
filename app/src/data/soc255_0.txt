Week 1: Obesity and sociological approaches to health


* Health defined-
   * World Health Organization
      * Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being
         * not merely the absence of disease or infirmity
   * Preventative vs. medical model
      * Medical Model
         * Absence of illness/disease
         * Prevalent model in US and industrialized nations
         * Skewed towards curative activities
            * More expensive 
               * Big pharma is expensive
               * Personalized medicine $$$
               * Band-aid; fixing the effects of disease without acknowledging the causes
            * US spends more money per capita than any other nation
      * Preventative Model
         * Focus is on preventing illness, rather than curing illness and disease
   * Morbidity and mortality
      * Morbidity
         * Illness (physical and mental)
         * Harder to measure accurately
         * CDC and National Center for Health Statistics collect surveys
            * Immigrants might have illness but aren’t aware
      * Mortality = death
         * Easier to define and measure
            * Exception of immigrant groups
         * Recorded on death certificates
         * Salmon bias hypothesis
            * Immigrants try to return home to die in their home country
               * Undercount deaths of immigrants
         * Changes in US mortality
            * Leading causes of death in 1900:
               * Infectious diseases
                  * pneumonia/flu, Tuberculosis, diarrhea/diphtheria
               * Prevented with improvements in public health
            * Leading causes of disease now:
               * Social environment-influenced lifestyle causing diseases        
                  * Cancer
                  * Heart disease
                  * Chronic lower respiratory diseases
* Sociology and health
   * Sociologists study health bc:
      * Unequal outcomes
         * Health is not evenly distributed in society
      * Tied to social environment
         * Lifestyle is affected by social environment
            * Rooted in social causes
            * Health is not individual; it is a societal problem
      * Health is ultimate indicator of inequality
         * mortality decreases by income
      * Does not dismiss biology and genetics
   * Sociology approaches vs others-
      * Sociologists-
