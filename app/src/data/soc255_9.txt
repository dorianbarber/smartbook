Study tips-

* Know 2-3 statistics for each topic
   * Change in absolute size and % of US population over time
   * Major origins prior to 1960s vs current


KNOW LINK AND PHELAN
* 3 CHARACTERISTICS OF FUNDAMENTAL CAUSE
   * How does being an immigrant relate




Social class- fundamental cause of disease
* Involves access to resources that can be used to avoid risk or minimize effects of disease
   * Safe neighborhoods, good health insurance
* Influences multiple risk factors and disease outcomes
   * Exposure to toxins, lack of access to nutrition, obesity, diabetes
* Maintains an association even when intervening mechanisms change
   * Provide someone in poverty with health insurance but health doesn’t improve. Why?
      * Not sustainable and doesn’t change the entire situation bc social status influences so many risk factors
         * Web of causation is why its fundamental
