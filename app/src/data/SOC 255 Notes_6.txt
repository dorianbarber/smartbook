bor contractors
   * Bracero Program, mostly agricultural workers
   * 1965 Immigration Act, largely unauthorized wave after Bracero was terminated that happened after the act ended national origin quotas and imposed the first numerical limits on Mexico and other LA countries
      * mostly male, seasonal farm laborers who traveled back and forth
   * Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), legalized close to 3 million unauthorized migrants in return for tougher border enforcement and penalties for American employers who hired unauthorized workers
* Reasons for decreasing Mexican immigration to the US
   * Great Recession
   * improved educational and economic opportunities in Mexico
   * tougher border enforcement
* Mexicans 
   * represent the largest unauthorized immigrant group in the US
   * less likely to be proficient in English or speak it at home than overall US foreign-born populations
   * lower educational attainment compared to foreign and native born
   * younger than overall US immigrant population but older than the native born
   * participate in labor force at slightly higher rate than overall immigrant and native born in mostly service occupations
   * lower incomes compared to foreign and native
   * poverty rate also higher than both
   * 11.6 Mexican immigrants in 2013, 28% of total US foreign born population
   * majority who became lawful permanent residents were immediate relatives or held family-sponsored preference visas
   * most in 2013 were much more likely to be uninsured than both
Does Selective Migration Explain the Hispanic Paradox? A Comparative Analysis of Mexicans in the U.S. and Mexico by Bostean
* Two main explanations have come to dominate the research on this epidemiologic ‘‘Hispanic paradox’’ 
   * Latino health is protected by cultural factors, such as a traditional diet and familial support, that deteriorate with acculturation
   * migrants are selected by health status, with healthier people immigrating to the U.S. and unhealthy people emigrating from the U.S
   * ‘‘Healthy migrant’’ hypothesis: Mexican immigrants in the U.S. are healthier than non-migrants in Mexico
   * ‘‘Salmon-bias’’ hypothesis: return-migrants (those who migrated to the U.S. and subsequently returned to Mexico) are less healthy than Mexican immigrants in the U.S
   * however, selection mechanisms may vary for younger and older adults since both the likelihood of emigrating from Mexico, and that of returning to Mexico vary with age
      * young working-age adults whose reasons for migrating are usually financial and likely quite different from those of older adults, who may migrate to accompany family members; therefore, results from studies on older adults may not be generalizable to younger migrants
   * this finding corroborates previous research suggesting that acculturation has deleterious effects on immigrant health
   * this study’s findings provided support for both a healthy migrant effect and salmon-bias for activity limitation, but these selection effects did not appear relevant in self-rated health or chronic conditions
   * plausible explanation is that having an activity limitation hinders migration to the United States among those in Mexico, but encourages Mexicans in the U.S. to re-emigrate back to Mexico
   * migrants are positively selected in some health aspects, negatively selected in others, and in yet other health outcomes, there is no selection effect
   * selective migration plays a role in explaining some of U.S. Latinos’ health outcomes, but is not the only explanation and does not account for the Paradox
Gender and National Origin Differences in Healthcare Utilization Among U.S. Immigrants from Mexico, China, and India by Read and Smith
* Chinese immigrants are less likely than Mexican and Indian immigrants to have seen a doctor in the past year, a finding that is largely driven by a lack of health insurance
* female immigrants are more likely than males to have done so, despite having fewer resources that enable access to care (e.g. income, English proficiency)
* relationship between gender and utilization is moderated by English language proficiency: among immigrants with low levels of proficiency, women are significantly more likely than men to have seen a doctor in the past year, while no difference exists between men and women who are proficient in English
   * this pattern is most evident among Mexican, and to a lesser extent, Indian immigrants
* utilization is different from access because it gauges the likelihood and frequency of individuals coming into contact with the healthcare system
   * important concept because many health conditions require a medical diagnosis for appropriate treatment, such as hypertension or diabetes
* immigrant women are more likely than immigrant men to arrive on family reunification visas, less likely to be employed once in the U.S., and earn less when they are employed
Health Assimilation among Hispanic Immigrants in the United States: The Impact of Ignoring Arrival-cohort Effects by Hamilton
* health (i.e., self-rated health) of Hispanic immigrants varies by both arrival cohort and U.S. tenure for immigrants hailing from most of the primary sending countries/regions of Hispanic immigrants
* omitting arrival cohort measures from health assimilation models may result in overestimates of the degree of downward health assimilation experienced by Hispanic immigrants.
* more recent immigrant arrival cohorts have more favorable initial health profiles
   * this pattern could reflect changes in U.S. immigration laws that negatively affected the flow of less healthy immigrants to the United States, particularly immigrants from Mexico and Central America
* earlier immigrants probably had lesser health to BEGIN with compared to modern day immigrant groups
Class Notes (9/26): Hispanic Immigrants 
* Hispanic population 17.6% or 55 million 
* Mexican Population
   * 32 million
   * 64% are US born
   * 36% foreign born
      * 6 million legal
      * 5.6 million illegal
* US Immigration Policies
   * Bracero Program (1942-1964)
      * manual laborer worker program that paid 30 cents/hour
   * 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act
      * imposed numerical limits on Mexican immigrants
   * IRCA 1986
      * toughened border security and increased penalties
* Result of Historical Policies?
   * Hispanics have high employment rates, but:
      * low English proficiency
      * low educational attainment
      * low social class status
      * high rates of poverty
* Poverty
   * pre-tax income, doesn’t vary geographically
   * in 2015, % in poverty
      * 13.2% of Americans (43.1 million)
   * cost of childcare in NC: 1 child, $16,000
      * threshold: single parent w/ one child, $19,000
* Mechanisms Linking Low Status to Health: Stress
   * worse economic conditions
      * less likely to be working, and working-full time
      * less subjectively rewarding jobs and more $$
   * few social-psychological resources
      * less sense of control over life and health status
      * lower levels of social support
   * worse health behaviors
      * more smoking, less exercise, fewer health checkups
* How Does Stress Get “In” the Body?
   * cortisol and epinephrine (adrenaline), have both protective and damaging effects on the body
   * four conditions that lead to allostatic load
      * repeated frequency of stress response to multiple novel stressors
      * failure to habituate to repeated stressors of the same kind
      * failure to turn off each stress response in a timely manner due to delayed shut down
      * inadequate response that leads to compensatory hyperactivity of other mediators
* Discussion
   * men who picked men doctors, disclosed less information
   * Chinese, Eastern medicine and different ideas of healthcare system (hospital = death)
