zed immigrant population peaked around 2007, then dipped due to economic recession


US immigration policies: 
Bracero Program (1942-1964) manual worker program that paid 30 cents/hr
1965 Immigration and Nationality Act-imposed numerical limits on Mexican immigrants, but had family reunification component
IRCA (1968)-gave legal status to undocumented immigrants to gain legal status, but strengthened border security for future illegal crossings


Result of historical policies: 
        High employment rates BUT
        Low english proficiency, low education, low social status, high poverty rates


Challenges that affect Health and Access to care for hispanics:
        Language other english spoken at home, less than high school education, food insecure household (poor nutrition), reporting living in an unsafe neighborhood (less physical activity, resources) 


Median income: black (36,000), hispanic (43,000), all races (53,000), white (63,000), asian (70,000)


Poverty: 
Poverty threshold based on pre-tax income, doesnâ€™t vary geographically
One person under 65: 12,000
One person over 65: 11,367
Single parent with one child: 16,337, Single parent with two children: 19,000
% in poverty: overall 13.2%, 9.1% of  whites, 24.1% of blacks, 21.4% of hispanics


Wealth (all assets-debts): for every $1 whites have, latinos have 7 cents, blacks have 6


Mechanisms linking low status to health: Stress
1. Worse economic conditions, less rewarding jobs, less likely to be working full time
2. Fewer social psychological resources: less sense of control over life and health, lower levels of social support
3. Worse health behaviors: more smoking, less exercise, fewer health check ups 
How Stress affects the body: 
Cortisol and epinephrine
Four conditions that lead to allostatic load: 
1. Repeated frequency of stress responses to multiple novel stressors, leads to permanently high cortisol and epinephrine 
2. Failure to habituate to repeated stressors of the same kind
3. Failure to turn off each stress response in a timely manner due to delayed shut down
4. Inadequate response that leads to compensatory hyperactivity of other mediators
Allostasis: what you want
