Where Health Disparities Begin: The Role of Social and Economic Determinants - And Why Current Policies May Make It Worse by Woolf and Braverman


* Intro
   * a shortsighted political focus on reducing spending could actually increase medical costs
   * unequal treatment report
      * standardize treatments
      * heighten providers’ cultural competency
      * increase representation among professionals
* The Social Determinants of Health
   * downstream determinants are shaped by upstream societal conditions
   * DS: medical care, environmental factors, health behaviors
   * US: education, income, social environment
   * social determinants are often root causes of illnesses, key to understanding health disparities
   * income and education, strong determinants of health
   * education and income are elements of a web of social and economic conditions that affect health and behaviors
* The Role Of Neighborhoods and Communities
   * unhealthy behavior isn’t just about choice, it’s about your environment
   * built environment: the way your neighborhood is set up, distressed homes
   * may also have reduced social cohesion, bad for unionizing and added stressors to safety
   * perpetuation of cycles of unemployment, lack of jobs
* Biological Pathways to Health Disparities
   * ppl living w/o adequate resources experience stress levels that alter immune function, cause inflammation, may have wear and tear on organs
   * some have delayed consequences that unfold over a lifetime (mom to child)
   * some genes can be modified by the environment, decides if a disease will develop or not depending on environment
* Declining Incomes and Increasing Inequality
   * average American’s wealth/income is shrinking, but increasing inequality
   * other countries are doing better and have more equal systems
* Policies, Macroeconomics, and Societal Structure
   * policymakers can have greater opportunity than health providers to narrow health disparities: ads, policies, etc. 
* The “Health in All Policies” Movement
   * policy that considers all consequences
* Linking Social Policy to Health Disparities
   * social and health policy are ultimately linked
   * value proposition of social programs should include medical spending avoided bc of programs
   * making the connection between social determinants and medical spending heightens the relevance of social policy to a pressing national priority: the spiraling costs of healthcare
* Why This Matters Now
   * 1: this is a time of worsening socioeconomic conditions and rising inequality, fomented by the recession and economic policies
   * 2: exposing children to today’s adverse social conditions has ramifications for the health of tomorrow’s adults
   * 3: the very programs that could cushion stresses on children and families are now vulnerable to proposed budget reductions
   * 4: presidential and congressional elections are fast approaching, and many politicians are eager to exhibit their fiscal conservatism by reducing the size of government and eliminating social programs


Who is Responsible for the Pain-Pill Epidemic by Gounder


* narcotics prescriptions rose, so did opioid-analgesic overdoses
* used to be only issues for short-term pain, but two studies came out that advertised narcotics as not addictive
* Purdue Pharma, J&J, Endo Pharma, aggressively marketed through professionals, doctors, publications, etc.
* PP disseminated educational materials on pain management that may have facilitated its access to hospitals to promote OxyContin
   * PP 2007, 3 top execs pleaded guilty to criminal charges that misled the FDA, etc. about opioid addiction in comparison to short-acting narcotics
* patients also part of the problem, welcomed it and pressured doctors
* health insurers are part of the problem here: they reliably cover prescription narcotics, but not necessarily these other medical tools


The Fattening of America: Introduction


* can be aware and rich, but still fat @ Uncle Al lmao
* the rise in obesity rates is having a profound impact on the U.S. economy
* two thirds of Americans are overweight or obese
* over the past three decades, the number of obese individuals has more than doubled
* the increase occurred for all population subsets, including children, the elderly, and all racial/ethnic groups up and down the socioeconomic spectrum
* when considering costs, we focus not only on the monetary costs, but also the time and other opportunity costs associated with undertaking certain activities
* America’s obesity epidemic has been shaped by economics
* basic tenet of economics is that people respond to their environment in predictable ways


The Fattening of America: Chapter One


* Intro
   * Changing economy affects health
      * Mauritanian women, food prices are high so they’re skinnier
      * US, food prices are low so they’re fatter
* My Soccer Team Eats Oranges
   * overweight is the government's term for obese kids
   * at-risk is the terminology for overweight kids
   * excess weight remains more common among African - American and Hispanic children than among whites
   * University of Illinois at Chicago: due to increases in the prevalence of childhood obesity, today’s children may not live as long as their parents
   * excess weight during childhood can also significantly increase the risk of disease and obesity in adulthood
   * increasing rates of childhood obesity also appear to be causing girls to reach puberty at an earlier age
* So How About Adults? Are We Gaining Too?
   * two thirds of Americans are now considered to be out of the “ normal ”weight range
   * body mass index (BMI), between 18.5 and 25 is considered normal
   * a BMI over 30 are considered obese
   * suggests that obesity rates began creeping up in the early to mid-twentieth century
      * probably due to food availability, less infectious disease, higher standard of living
   * 13 percent of the total U.S. population between 1960 and 1962 was obese
   * 32 percent of American adults were obese in 2004
   * obesity ’ s reach stretches broadly across the socioeconomic spectrum, it hits low-income the hardest
   * fat and getting fatter
* A Growing Waistline Can Be Bad for Your Health
   * poor diet and physical inactivity may soon overtake tobacco as the leading cause of death in America
      * Three leading causes: tobacco, poor diet and activity, alcohol
   * diabetes increases the risk for a host of other health problems, adversely affects nearly every system of the human body
* But Are We the Only Ones Gaining Weight?
   * world population has now reached the point where more people are overweight than undernourished — a trend found even in the world’s poorest countries
   * policy has shifted toward how to control increasing rates of obesity, even among relatively poor societies
* The Longer You Stay, the Bigger You Get
   * immigrants shown to gain more weight in the US than at home


The Fattening of America: Chapter Two


* First Things First
   * small changes in diet and exercise patterns can lead to large increases in weight
* Cheap Food Gets Cheaper
   * faults in a calorie intake study
      * 1: individuals eat less than usual when they know others will see their data
      * 2: due to laziness, etc. individuals tend not to report all they consume
   * economics is the reason behind calorie consumption
   * food costs, money and preparation time, have been dropping
   * high calorie foods have been much cheaper compared to healthier alternatives
   * as it becomes cheaper, ppl will eat it more
   * low prices translate into larger portions
   * price plays a major role into what and how much we eat
* The Rise of French-Fried Potatoes
   * food processing, preservation, and cooking technologies have allowed more foods to be produced in a central location, and consumed quicker and cheaper
   * 1950’s: The Golden Age of Food Processing
