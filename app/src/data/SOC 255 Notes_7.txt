ccounts for the cumulative impact of physiological responses to acute, chronic, or long-term psychosocial stressors generated by social conditions that continuously activate hormonal responses to stressful conditions
* for foreign-born Blacks, length of stay and age were powerful predictors of allostatic load scores
* for older US-born Blacks and those who were widowed, divorced, or separated, the risk of high allostatic load was greater
* foreign-born Blacks have a health advantage in allostatic load
* we found that time in the United States was a significant predictor of high allostatic load scores for foreign-born Blacks residing in the United States
* increased allostatic load was associated with increased age because cumulative adversity over the lifespan is associated with multisystem dysregulation
* research that suggests African immigrants’ superior health may be related to the fact that they are on average more highly educated than are US-born Blacks and Whites
* Caribbean and African immigrants have worse health over time because they have higher levels of psychological stress related to immigration and adjusting to new socio-cultural environment
* the impact of exposure to racism in the United States may be particularly stressful for immigrants from regions of the world where they were a demographic majority
Health Among Black Children by Maternal and Child Nativity by Hendi, Mehta, Elo
* children of foreign-born mothers were healthier across all 5 outcomes than were children of US-born mothers
* among children of foreign-born mothers, US-born children performed worse on all health outcomes than children born abroad
* African-origin children had the most favorable health profile
* longer duration of US residence among foreign-born mothers was associated with poorer child health
* maternal educational attainment and other socio-demographic characteristics did little to explain these differences
* there was a gradient such that children of US-born mothers fared worse than children of mothers born in Latin America or the Caribbean, who in turn fared worse than children of African-born mothers
* foreign-born children have significantly better health outcomes than US-born children, regardless of the nativity of the mother
* children of African-born mothers are generally healthier than children of Latin American-Caribbean born mothers, differences that could not be explained by the mother’s duration of US residence
* children of US-born mothers are more than twice as likely as children of African-born mothers to have been diagnosed with asthma
   * children of Latin American---Caribbean-born mothers, although significantly less likely to be diagnosed than children of US-born mothers, are nevertheless significantly more likely to be diagnosed with asthma than children of African-born mothers
   * similar patterns are observed for the child’s general health status, missed school days, activity limitations, and skin and respiratory allergies
* the lingering health advantage of children of migrants suggests that protective cultural traits from the cultures of origin (cultural buffering) may also play a role
* advantaged health patterns of African-origin children compared with Latin American---Caribbean-origin children, which were not explained by differences in duration of US residence, may be due to the greater selectivity of the African-born mothers (visa categories too)
   * African migration streams are more recent, and the distance is far greater for migrants from Africa than for those from Latin America and the Caribbean
   * among immigrant subgroups in the United States, African immigrants are the healthiest relative to people in the country of origin
Differing Birth Weight Among Infants of US Born Blacks, African-Born Blacks, and US Born Whites by David and Collins
* the rate of low birth weight in infants of African-born black women (3.6 percent) was closer to the rate in infants of U.S.- born white women (2.4 percent), and the rate in infants of U.S.-born black women remained high (7.5 percent)
* the birth-weight patterns of infants of African-born black women and U.S.-born white women are more closely related to one another than to the birth weights of infants of U.S.-born black women
* African-born black women delivered the highest proportion of infants who were their mothers’ fourth or subsequent children and had the highest proportion of previous fetal and infant deaths
* U.S.-born black women were the youngest, the least likely to be married, the least well educated, and the most likely to have received prenatal care late or not at all
* white women surpassed both groups of black women with regard to only one risk factor — primigravidity, first time being pregnant
* these data provide some evidence against the theory that there is a genetic basis for the disparity between white and black women born in the United States in the mean birth weights of their infants
* racial differences in birth weight persist independently of numerous social and economic risk factors
* if genetics played a prominent part in determining black–white differences in birth weight, the infants of the African-born black women should have had lower birth weights than those of the U.S.-born black women 
* found the opposite: regardless of socioeconomic status, the infants of black women born in Africa weighed more than the infants of comparable black women born in the United States
Discrimination and Health by Krieger
* racial/ethnic disparities often explain US racial/ethnic inequalities in health
* ecosocial theory: asks how we incorporate biologically, from conception to death, our social experiences and express this embodiment in population patterns of health, disease, and well-being 
   * draws attention to why and how societal conditions daily produce population distributions of health
   * posits how we develop, grow, age, ail, and die necessarily reflects a constant interplay of our intertwined and inseparable social and biological history
* types of discrimination: race/ethnic, gender, sexuality, disability, age, class
* Discrimination
   * to make an adverse distinction, to distinguish unfavorably from others
   * de jure: mandated by law, i.e. Jim Crow
   * de facto: without legal basis but sanctioned by custom/practice i.e. underrepresentation of marginalized groups
   * all means of expressing and institutionalizing social relationships of dominance and oppression
   * types
      * legal
      * illegal
      * overt
      * covert
      * institutional (organizational): discriminatory policies or practices carried out by state or non-state institutions
      * structural (systemic): totality of ways in which societies foster discrimination
      * interpersonal (individual): directly perceived discriminatory interactions between individuals 
* Patterns of Discrimination
   * experience discrimination in the present
   * experience multiple forms of discrimination
   * different types can occur in about every facet of public and private life
      * everyday discrimination, covert but always present
   * while some experiences of discrimination may be interpersonal and obvious, others maybe be institutional and invisible
   * US racial attitudes believe that discrimination is a thing of the past
* Approaches to Quantifying Health Effects of Discrimination
   * indirectly (individual): examine whether known risk factors explain differences in health outcomes between members of dominant and subordinate groups; if not, infer discrimination may contribute to residual differences
   * directly (self-reports): among subordinate groups, examine whether self-reported experiences of discrimination are associated w/ specific health outcomes
   * institutional (population level): among subordinate groups, examine whether group-level measures of discrimination are associated w/ population rates of health outcome
   * investigating health
