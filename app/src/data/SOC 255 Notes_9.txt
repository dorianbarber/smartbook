   * selectivity hypothesis: theories of immigrant selectivity would lead us to hypothesize that black immigrants will be healthier than U.S.-born blacks, and that among black immigrants, their health status will vary by region of birth
   * the costs of the journey to the United States are substantially higher from Africa, not simply because of the higher transportation costs, but also because the United States has greater control over immigration flows from Africa, and immigrant networks that can assist with resettlement are less established from African compared to South American, West Indian and European sending areas
   * Results
   * two patterns are immediately apparent
   * the health of U.S.-born blacks is far below that of U.S.-born whites across health measures
   * the “foreign-born” category obscures considerable heterogeneity in black immigrant health
   * looking at self-rated health, for example, U.S.-born blacks are 62 percent more likely to rate their health as “fair or poor” compared to U.S.-born whites, while foreign-born blacks do not appear to differ significantly from the majority white population
   * when broken down by region of birth, we see that African immigrants are healthier than U.S.-born whites; South American and West immigrants do not significantly differ from them; and European immigrants are much less healthy
   * Discussion
   * central claim is that racial context of origin in combination with immigrant selectivity is an important mechanism by which race affects the health status of foreign- and native-born black Americans
   * the results suggest that grouping together foreign-born blacks conceals important differences among this population
   * though awaiting further corroborating evidence, we theorize that the story of the superior health of black immigrants is two-fold
   * the health advantage holds only for those immigrants coming from minority white regions
   * given the work on second generation immigrants this advantage will be difficult to pass on to their children
   * “Americanization” (Landale et al. 1999) may hurt immigrant health – the longer black immigrants are in the United States, the greater their cumulative exposure to stressful life events associated with minority status 
Class Notes (10/3): Black Immigrants 
   * Evidence of Disparities
   * Black-white differences in mortality and morbidity stable despite rapid advances in technology
   * US-born Black Americans
   * shorter life expectancies
   * higher disability rates
   * higher rates of chronic diseases
   * less access to health care 
   * infant mortality rates used to measure health of a country (post-neonatal too)
   * premature birth (PB): less than 37 weeks of gestation
   * low birth weight (LBW): less than 2500 grams (5.5 lbs)
   * if you’re both, prediction of:
   * infant mortality
   * childhood: cognitive/language delay, school failure, psychomotor problems, subnormal growth
   * adulthood: cancer, cardiovascular conditions, diabetes, arthritis
   * LBW predicts adult obesity: nutritionally deprived newborns are programmed to eat more bc develop less neurons in the region of the brain that controls food intake 
   * Explanations for Racial Disparities
   * genetics largely discounted
   * social position
   * buffers against stress
   * discrimination and racism
   * Explanations: Discrimination
   * process by which members of a group are treated differently (unfairly) on the basis of belonging to that group
   * de jure (law) and de facto (reality/culture/practices)
   * impact of discrimination
   * everyday discrimination (David Williams, created scale)
   * Krieger article
   * Why does discrimination matter?
   * experiencing discrimination triggers feelings of being:
   * over-scrutinized
   * overlooked
   * underappreciated
   * misunderstood
   * disrespected
   * violates cultural expectations of fairness, morality, dignity, human rights
   * allostasis: ability to maintain stability through change
   * Importance of Black Immigrants for US Racial Disparities
   * 3% to increased to 9% of US black population, roughly 1 in 5 is an immigrant 
   * Projected to be 16.5% of black population in 2060
   * Why do Black immigrants matter?
   * immigrants from diverse origins
   * 50% Caribbean (Jamaica, Haiti): family preference
   * 39% from Africa: diversity visas
   * immigrants on diverse visas
   * likely translates into diverse health outcomes
   * visa categories matter bc it determines how you immigrate
   * share same racial status as black Americans but experience significantly better health
   * 2nd generation does poorly on many outcomes
   * Mary Water’s research on Caribbean immigrants in NYC
   * more likely to work, work more hours, higher incomes than US born black
   * immigrants come from societies where not the racial minority often w/ accents allow them to be perceived differently
   * over time, advantages erode: without accents and raised in US context, second gen looks identical to US blacks
   * advantages parents bring w/ them wash away in new racial context of origin for their children
   * TLDR: racial context and origin matters to health, experience of being a racial minority or majority 
   * Ways Region of Origin Affects Health
   * exposure to stressful life events (discrimination)
   * position in the stratification system (social position)
   * racial identity formation
   * reference group: for US-born blacks the reference is in the US and for immigrant blacks the reference location is region of origin
   * self-rated health relative to whom?
