n preventing illness, rather than curing illness and disease
* Measuring Health
   * mortality = death
      * easier to define and measure
      * exception is immigrant groups
         * salmon bias hypothesis, if can will return back home if sick
   * morbidity = illness (physical and mental)
      * harder to measure accurately bc reports are inaccurate, missing ppl’s true information bc access to healthcare, etc.
* Changes in US Mortality
   * leading causes of death 1900
      * influenza, TB, pneumonia
   * leading causes of death now
      * heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases 
* Why Social Scientists Study Health Pt.1
* sociologists study health bc lifestyle is affected by the social environment
      * health is the ultimate indicator of inequality
      * not evenly distributed in society
      * rooted in social causes
      * does not dismiss biology and genetics 
* Sociological Approach vs. Other Disciplines
   * sociologists: focus on factors more distance from the outcome (social class, gender) - fundamental causes
   * epidemiologist: focus on proximal factors (diet, exercise, smoking)
   * medical doctors; tend to focus on biological factors (cholesterol levels)
* Why Social Scientists Study Health Pt.2
   * social environment influences health
      * health isn’t an individual issue or a societal problem
   * evidence
      * example #1: obesity
      * example #2: opioid crisis 
   * key theme: tension between the goals of for-profit private organizations (food and pharma industries) and the ability and desire for gov regulation of public health 
* Why Care About These Trends
   * diabetes                - poor mental health                - 
   * hypertension                - heart disease                - metabolic syndrome
* What Has Contributed to These Trends?
   * unhealthy food is cheaper
      * since 1978, food prices have dropped by 38%
      * greatest drops are for calorie dense foods
      * prices for healthy foods have gone up
   * sedentary life is easier now
   * massive economic changes
      * women in the workforce, longer commutes, not enough to cook or teach about health
   * changes in social and cultural norms
      * fast food culture, Sundays in the South
   * changes in food and marketing
      * targeting children, different ingredients
* Food Industry
   * $35 billion annually in advertising
      * 70% on non-nutritious foods
      * 2% on fruits, veggies, grains
      * heavily marketed to kids 
* Where It Began
   * late 1990s, pharmaceutical companies encouraged doctors to prescribe opioid pain relievers
   * claimed patients wouldn’t become addicted
   * pharma companies pushed major marketing campaigns including promo videos
   * doctors began widely prescribing the medications and later discovered their addictive nature
* In 2015
   * 2 million ppl had a substance use disorder related to prescription opioids
   * 591,000 people had a heroin use disorder
   * 33,000_ ppl died from opioid overdose (out of 52,000 total overdoses)
   * preliminary evidence from 2016: 59,000-65,000 died from overdoses 
   * middle-age white men
      * have insurance, money to get prescription drugs to get addicted in the first place
* Opioid as a Gateway to Heroin
   * 21-29% of patients given an opioid prescription for chronic pain misuse them
   * 4-6% who misuse prescription opioids transition to heroin
   * 75% of heroin users first misused prescription opioids 
Changing Patterns in U.S. Immigration and Population: Immigrants Slow Population Decline in Many Counties by Pew Report 2014
* U.S. Census Bureau projects that net international migration to the United States will become the primary driver of the nation’s population growth between 2027 and 2038
* immigrants have moved beyond traditional gateways
   * growth in the foreign-born population has extended beyond traditional gateways—such as California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, and Texas—into other areas of the United States, especially the Southeast and the Pacific Northwest
* native-born population has declined in Middle America
   * while the foreign-born population was increasing and dispersing, the native-born population was declining in certain areas of the country
* immigration has driven population growth in the Sun Belt, Pacific Northwest, and Mountain States
   * areas where the overall population has increased and how the foreign-born population has contributed to that growth
   * increases in the number of immigrants have driven overall growth in many counties, particularly in the South and West
* immigration has slowed population declines in Middle America
   * changes in foreign- and native-born populations and highlights areas where the growth of the foreign-born population has slowed overall decline and sometimes has overcome native-born losses for a net population gain
* immigrants have the potential to offset population decline in some areas of the country, immigrants can also compensate for the aging of the native-born population
* foreign born: an individual who was not a U.S. citizen at birth or who was born outside the United States, Puerto Rico, or other U.S. territories and whose parents are not U.S. citizens
* native born: those who are U.S. citizens at birth, namely people born in the United States, Puerto Rico, or other U.S. territories and those born abroad to at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen
* total population: throughout this brief, “total” or “overall” population refers to the adult population 18 years and older
* impact of immigration on demographic change is vital to analyzing the economic and fiscal effect immigrants have on states and localities










Social Conditions as Fundamental Causes of Disease by Phelan + Link
* Intro
   * we question the emphasis on such individually-based risk factors and argue that greater attention must be paid to basic social conditions if health reform is to have its maximum effect in the time ahead
      * individually-based risk factors must be contextualized, by examining what puts people at risk of risks, if we are to craft effective interventions and improve the nation's health
      * social factors such as socioeconomic status and social support are likely "fundamental causes" of disease that, because they embody access to important resources, affect multiple disease outcomes through multiple mechanisms, and consequently maintain an association with disease even when intervening mechanisms change
   * this focus on proximate risk factors, potentially controllable at the individual level, resonates with the value and belief systems of Western culture that emphasize both the ability of the individual to control his or her personal fate and the importance of doing so
* Evidence Linking Social Conditions to Disease
   * social conditions as factors that involve a person's relationships to other people
   * one approach uses quasi-experimental strategies which involve locating conditions under which alternative explanations make different predictions about observable facts
   * one approach where medical sociologists and social epidemiologists identify social risk factors that cannot reasonably be conceived as having been caused by an individual's illness condition
   * one approach is longitudinal designs
      * some longitudinal studies do not allow clear inferences about time order and therefore do not provide the definitive evidence about causality that is sometimes attributed to them
   * the common mechanism underlying low power and role overload is a decreased sense of personal control, which is in turn related to symptoms of anxiety and depression
   * we have described two characterizations of social conditions as causes of disease that either advertently or inadvertently downplay their importance
      * outright declaration that social factors are only proxies for true causes
      * the view that social fa
