 is in the US whereas for immigrant blacks, the reference location is region of origin
-Compared to all other U.S. major racial groups, blacks have the highest rates of morbidity and mortality for almost all diseases, highest disability rates, shortest life expectancies, least access to health care, and startlingly low rates of the use of modern technology in their treatment 
-the gap between blacks and whites has actually widened in the past century
-foreign born black immigrant “advantage” varies by region of birth and reference category
Ex: superior health of south american blacks compared to west indian, poorer health of european blacks (due to being a minority in europe and dealing with racism)
-health advantage will not survive across generations in the US because black immigrants from all immigrants resemble US born blacks
-possible cultural bias: africans, south americans, west indian immigrants may give a more positive interpretation of their health than european or US born blacks


--african born children of african born mothers have better health outcomes than us born blacks or latin american born children of latin american born mothers


10/3 lecture: 
1. Evidence of black and white health disparities (not just immigrants, but all blacks)
-black white differences in mortality and morbidity stable overtime, though overall population health has gotten better
-blacks have shorter life expectancies, higher disability rates, less access to health care
-black male life expectancy at birth 1960-2016: 60, 72.5 yrs
-white female life expectancy at birth 1960-2016: 76, 81.4
-infant mortality: often predicted by premature birth: less than 37 wks, and low birth weight: less than 5.5 pounds. Also linked to cognitive delay in childhood, school failure, cancer and heart problems in adulthood
        -per 1000 births, black women have sightly over double infant mortality rates (grew from twice as high in 1960 to almost 3 times in 2016). 


1. Major explanations for disparities( genetics, social position, discrimination and racism)
-genetics is largely discounted
-social position (buffers against stress)
-discrimination: process by which members of a group are treated differently
