of Discrimination * indirectly (individual): examine whether known risk factors explain differences in health outcomes between members of dominant and subordinate groups; if not, infer discrimination may contribute to residual differences * directly (self-reports): among subordinate groups, examine whether self-reported experiences of discrimination are associated w/ specific health outcomes * institutional (population level): among subordinate groups, examine whether group-level measures of discrimination are associated w/ population rates of health outcome * investigating health outcomes of groups since discrimination itself is hard to measure * “personal/group” discrimination discrepancy: ppl typically report perceiving greater discrimination directed towards their group rather than to themselves * factors why individuals reporting difference experiences of discrimination even when subjected to same “exposure” * internalized oppression: members internalize negative views of dominant culture and accept their status and unfair treatment as “deserved”/non-discriminatory * some may see discrimination as “positive traits” attributed to them by the dominant group
