immigrants especially Mexico -more pronounced arrival-cohort effects for women -hispanic immigrants have infant health profiles and mortality rates that are similar to whites, despite having lower ses, advantage diminishes over time (does it put hispanics on the same level as people of their ses? Does their ses increase/decrease over time?) -explanations for healthy immigrant effect: selective migration, cultural buffering(better cultural habits: less smoking, alcohol, drugs) -gender differences: bmi of female hispanic immigrants converge to those of us born counterparts in 10 years, vs 15 for males, men may be more positively selected for health for job purposes -women may be more susceptible to acculturation due to gender roles -effect of epidemiological transition in sending country: increased obesity in home country-->later immigrants are obese/have other health problems -destination country: changing immigration policy, like more restrictions lead to different immigrant cohort -results: immigrant men in 1980 had lower health advantage over native
