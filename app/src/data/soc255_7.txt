ant mortality is at least consistently double whites
* Gap has grown
   * 1960- blacks 44.3, whites 22.9
   * 2016- blacks 11.1, whites 4.8


Black immigrants are continuing to contribute to black population, especially as their numbers grow


Explanations for racial disparities
* Genetics largely discounted
   * Genetic human variation between populations is modest 
      * If its genetic gene, African gene should be strongest for women born in Africa
      * But African born look most like US white women
* Social position
   * Buffers against stress
* Discrimination and racism
   * Better at measuring this 


Discrimination- process by which members of a group are treated differently on the basis of belonging to that group
* Two types
   * De jure- in law
      * Jim Crow laws, institutionalized racism
   * De facto- in reality
      * Colorblind racism, neighborhoods that result in school segregation


Everyday discrimination scale by David R Williams
* Experiencing discirmination triggers feelings of being
   * Over scrutinized
   * Overlooked 
   * Underappreciated
   * Misunderstood
   * Disrespected
* Violate cultural expectations of fairness, morality , dignity and human rights
* Elevated stress accumulates over time= poor health outcomes
   * Create stress through allostatic load
   * In 2015, 23% of blacks said they experienced discrimination at least once a week


How stress impacts health: allostatic load
* Repeated frequency of stress responses to multiple novel stressors
* Failure to habituate to repeated stressors of the same kind
* Failure to turn off each stress response in timely manner due to delayed shut down
* Inadequate response that leads to compensatory hyperactivity of other mediators
Allostatis- ability to maintain stability through change


Need to understand how immigrants are contributing to health profile of US


Importance of black immigrants for US racial disparities
* Tripled in size 3% to 9% of black population since 1980
* Projected to be 16.5% of black population in 2060


Why do black immigrants matter?
* From diverse origins
   * 50% from Caribbean (Jamaica, haiti)
   * 39% from Africa
* On diverse visas
   * Immigrants coming in on diversity visas are pre-selected (probably have good health)
   * Refugees - low health
   * Translates into diverse health outcomes
* Share same status as black Americans but have significantly better health
   * 2nd
