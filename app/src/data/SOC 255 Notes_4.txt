OT)
   * number of ppl moved across borders through schemes of indentured work, coercion and deception, unlawful payment
* Future of Refugee Resettlement
   * fewer refugees arriving legally in the West as screening is more rigorous and time-consuming than in the past
   * fewer refugees or immigrants are arriving illegally in the West as border security is more rigorous than in the past
      * large numbers of illegal refugees and immigrants do cross to join large numbers already present
   * vast number of refugees continue to flee war, persecution, famine, and other man-made and natural disasters
Refugee and Immigrant Health: Ch. 3
* Intro
   * first point of contact w/ health care for refugees is usually at emergency care at temporary border refugee camp in country of first asylum
   * services usually provided by NGOs
   * most common first point of contact:
      * refugee resettlement agencies
      * gov refugee transit centers
   * basic screening and referral or treatment:
      * identify communicable diseases that are public health risks
      * eliminate health-related barriers to successful adaption
   * most undocumented immigrants aren’t screened, delayed contact w/ healthcare system
* Level 1: Acute Phase
   * attracts the most concern bc of communicable nature of illnesses
   * public health threat
   * parasitism among refugee groups
* Level 2: Transition
   * usually children’s needs are met, then adults will come forward seeking care
   * some ask for prescription drugs to send back home to family, doctor shopping
   * communicable diseases more prevalent in first stage, but chronic illnesses begin to develop here
* Level 3: Chronic
   * 10+ years after resettlement, most likely to live in isolated enclaves, little access to health/social services, unable to speak or write in host language, poor health/SES
   * assimilated, educated, and employed immigrants are unlikely to enter this phase
   * factors to the chronic state:
      * high and often sustained levels of trauma
      * greater number of resettlement stressors
      * financial stress
   * chronic state of refugee status/poor health is lived out or expressed in several ways:
      * traditional family structures break down
      * segments of the population gain assimilation/move into middle working class while others go into “neither here nor there” world of ethnic ghetto
      * untreated chronic health problems accumulate, takes a toll
   * complexities of cultural isolation and barriers to healthcare access
      * eventually loses contact w/ healthcare staff
   * increases in prevalence of self-abusive behaviors (alcohol, etc.)
* Immigrants
   * health status varies w/ circumstances of immigration
   * “a sadness from losing their sense of place”

   * increasingly more diverse gateway cities and secondary destinations
* What has Contributed to These Changes?
   * immigration is a result of factors and policies in the sending countries and countries of reception
   * US immigration policies have played a major role in shaping current size/composition of immigrants 
* History of US Immigration
   * colonial period (1600’s to 1776; Northern Europe)
   * mid and late 19th century (Northern Europe)
      * 1882 CEA, banned new laborers for 10 years and denied path to citizenship leaving 1000s unemployed

         * you can move someone poor to a better neighborhood, but they’re still poor; bandaid fix
   * *race and ethnicity is a fundamental social status 
   * stress
Immigrant America: Ch. 2
Compared to Whom? Subjective Social Status, Self-rated Health, and Referent Group Sensitivity in a Diverse US Sample by Wolff
* research has show that how people perceive their position in the social hierarchy, is significantly associated with multiple health outcomes
* scholars have suggested that individuals may prefer to make comparisons to those who share similar characteristics to themselves
* social status indicators are comprised of different types of measures, some assessing actual economic resources and others capturing prestige-related characteristics
* there has been little empirical analysis assessing the health impact of comparing oneself to one referent group over another
* we hypothesized that there would be significant racial/ethnic differences in the relationship between SSS and self-rated health, particularly when using the distal referent group of others in American society
* ratio tests indicate that an SSS measure using the more distal referent group, others in American society, appears to have a stronger association with self-rated health than measures using other referent groups and also provides the most parsimonious model
* the relationship between SSS and self-rated health was strongest with this national comparison and also did not differ by race/ethnicity
* how people perceive their subjective social position is strongly predictive of their self-rated health status


Not Everyone Chosen: Segmented Assimilation
* assimilation has different outcomes
* second generation
   * undergoing a process of segmented assimilation: outcomes vary across immigrant minorities and where rapid integration and acceptance into the American mainstream represent just one possible alternative
* factors
   * history of the immigrant first generation
   * pace of acculturation among parents and children and its bearing on normative integration
   * barriers, cultural and economic, confronted by second gen youth in their quest for successful adaptation
   * the family and community resources for confronting these barriers
* How Immigrants Are Received: Modes of Incorporation and Their Consequences
   * immigrants differ along three dimensions
      * individual features (age, education, English, wealth)
      * social environment that receives them, policies of the gov, attitudes of the native population, size and presence of the co-ethnic community
      * family structure
* Acculturation and Role Reversal
