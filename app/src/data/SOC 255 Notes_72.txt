self-rated health, for example, U.S.-born blacks are 62 percent more likely to rate their health as “fair or poor” compared to U.S.-born whites, while foreign-born blacks do not appear to differ significantly from the majority white population * when broken down by region of birth, we see that African immigrants are healthier than U.S.-born whites; South American and West immigrants do not significantly differ from them; and European immigrants are much less healthy * Discussion * central claim is that racial context of origin in combination with immigrant selectivity is an important mechanism by which race affects the health status of foreign- and native-born black Americans * the results suggest that grouping together foreign-born blacks conceals important differences among this population * though awaiting further corroborating evidence, we theorize that the story of the superior health of black immigrants is two-fold * the health advantage holds only for those immigrants
