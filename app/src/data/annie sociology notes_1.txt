migrants especially Mexico
-more pronounced arrival-cohort effects for women
-hispanic immigrants have infant health profiles and mortality rates that are similar to whites, despite having lower ses, advantage diminishes over time (does it put hispanics on the same level as people of their ses? Does their ses increase/decrease over time?)
-explanations for healthy immigrant effect: selective migration, cultural buffering(better cultural habits: less smoking, alcohol, drugs)
-gender differences: bmi of female hispanic immigrants converge to those of us born counterparts in 10 years, vs 15 for males, men may be more positively selected for health for job purposes
        -women may be more susceptible to acculturation due to gender roles
-effect of epidemiological transition in sending country: increased obesity in home country-->later immigrants are obese/have other health problems
-destination country: changing immigration policy, like more restrictions lead to different immigrant cohort
-results: immigrant men in 1980 had lower health advantage over native born compared to immigrant men in 2011 who had a higher advantage
-arrival cohort: people arriving at different points in time have different circumstances in origin and host country
 -”For example, many Latin American countries are rapidly advancing through the epidemiological transition. A number of these nations are facing a double epidemiologic burden where they have not yet eradicated infectious diseases but are also simultaneously faced with increasing rates of chronic illnesses (Brenes-Camacho and Rosero-Bixby 2008; Palloni et al. 2006). This is related to the nutrition transition that Latin American countries have undergone, whereby as malnutrition decreased, obesity rapidly increased, and this has led to increases in related morbidities, such as diabetes and high cholesterol”
- “We find that omitting arrival-cohort controls from models of immigrant health assimilation results in overestimates of the degree of downward health assimilation experienced by immigrants. We also find that the initial health stocks of earlier immigrant arrival cohorts may have been worse relative to those of more recent immigrants. These
