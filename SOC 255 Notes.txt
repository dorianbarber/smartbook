Where Health Disparities Begin: The Role of Social and Economic Determinants - And Why Current Policies May Make It Worse by Woolf and Braverman


* Intro
   * a shortsighted political focus on reducing spending could actually increase medical costs
   * unequal treatment report
      * standardize treatments
      * heighten providers’ cultural competency
      * increase representation among professionals
* The Social Determinants of Health
   * downstream determinants are shaped by upstream societal conditions
   * DS: medical care, environmental factors, health behaviors
   * US: education, income, social environment
   * social determinants are often root causes of illnesses, key to understanding health disparities
   * income and education, strong determinants of health
   * education and income are elements of a web of social and economic conditions that affect health and behaviors
* The Role Of Neighborhoods and Communities
   * unhealthy behavior isn’t just about choice, it’s about your environment
   * built environment: the way your neighborhood is set up, distressed homes
   * may also have reduced social cohesion, bad for unionizing and added stressors to safety
   * perpetuation of cycles of unemployment, lack of jobs
* Biological Pathways to Health Disparities
   * ppl living w/o adequate resources experience stress levels that alter immune function, cause inflammation, may have wear and tear on organs
   * some have delayed consequences that unfold over a lifetime (mom to child)
   * some genes can be modified by the environment, decides if a disease will develop or not depending on environment
* Declining Incomes and Increasing Inequality
   * average American’s wealth/income is shrinking, but increasing inequality
   * other countries are doing better and have more equal systems
* Policies, Macroeconomics, and Societal Structure
   * policymakers can have greater opportunity than health providers to narrow health disparities: ads, policies, etc. 
* The “Health in All Policies” Movement
   * policy that considers all consequences
* Linking Social Policy to Health Disparities
   * social and health policy are ultimately linked
   * value proposition of social programs should include medical spending avoided bc of programs
   * making the connection between social determinants and medical spending heightens the relevance of social policy to a pressing national priority: the spiraling costs of healthcare
* Why This Matters Now
   * 1: this is a time of worsening socioeconomic conditions and rising inequality, fomented by the recession and economic policies
   * 2: exposing children to today’s adverse social conditions has ramifications for the health of tomorrow’s adults
   * 3: the very programs that could cushion stresses on children and families are now vulnerable to proposed budget reductions
   * 4: presidential and congressional elections are fast approaching, and many politicians are eager to exhibit their fiscal conservatism by reducing the size of government and eliminating social programs


Who is Responsible for the Pain-Pill Epidemic by Gounder


* narcotics prescriptions rose, so did opioid-analgesic overdoses
* used to be only issues for short-term pain, but two studies came out that advertised narcotics as not addictive
* Purdue Pharma, J&J, Endo Pharma, aggressively marketed through professionals, doctors, publications, etc.
* PP disseminated educational materials on pain management that may have facilitated its access to hospitals to promote OxyContin
   * PP 2007, 3 top execs pleaded guilty to criminal charges that misled the FDA, etc. about opioid addiction in comparison to short-acting narcotics
* patients also part of the problem, welcomed it and pressured doctors
* health insurers are part of the problem here: they reliably cover prescription narcotics, but not necessarily these other medical tools


The Fattening of America: Introduction


* can be aware and rich, but still fat @ Uncle Al lmao
* the rise in obesity rates is having a profound impact on the U.S. economy
* two thirds of Americans are overweight or obese
* over the past three decades, the number of obese individuals has more than doubled
* the increase occurred for all population subsets, including children, the elderly, and all racial/ethnic groups up and down the socioeconomic spectrum
* when considering costs, we focus not only on the monetary costs, but also the time and other opportunity costs associated with undertaking certain activities
* America’s obesity epidemic has been shaped by economics
* basic tenet of economics is that people respond to their environment in predictable ways


The Fattening of America: Chapter One


* Intro
   * Changing economy affects health
      * Mauritanian women, food prices are high so they’re skinnier
      * US, food prices are low so they’re fatter
* My Soccer Team Eats Oranges
   * overweight is the government's term for obese kids
   * at-risk is the terminology for overweight kids
   * excess weight remains more common among African - American and Hispanic children than among whites
   * University of Illinois at Chicago: due to increases in the prevalence of childhood obesity, today’s children may not live as long as their parents
   * excess weight during childhood can also significantly increase the risk of disease and obesity in adulthood
   * increasing rates of childhood obesity also appear to be causing girls to reach puberty at an earlier age
* So How About Adults? Are We Gaining Too?
   * two thirds of Americans are now considered to be out of the “ normal ”weight range
   * body mass index (BMI), between 18.5 and 25 is considered normal
   * a BMI over 30 are considered obese
   * suggests that obesity rates began creeping up in the early to mid-twentieth century
      * probably due to food availability, less infectious disease, higher standard of living
   * 13 percent of the total U.S. population between 1960 and 1962 was obese
   * 32 percent of American adults were obese in 2004
   * obesity ’ s reach stretches broadly across the socioeconomic spectrum, it hits low-income the hardest
   * fat and getting fatter
* A Growing Waistline Can Be Bad for Your Health
   * poor diet and physical inactivity may soon overtake tobacco as the leading cause of death in America
      * Three leading causes: tobacco, poor diet and activity, alcohol
   * diabetes increases the risk for a host of other health problems, adversely affects nearly every system of the human body
* But Are We the Only Ones Gaining Weight?
   * world population has now reached the point where more people are overweight than undernourished — a trend found even in the world’s poorest countries
   * policy has shifted toward how to control increasing rates of obesity, even among relatively poor societies
* The Longer You Stay, the Bigger You Get
   * immigrants shown to gain more weight in the US than at home


The Fattening of America: Chapter Two


* First Things First
   * small changes in diet and exercise patterns can lead to large increases in weight
* Cheap Food Gets Cheaper
   * faults in a calorie intake study
      * 1: individuals eat less than usual when they know others will see their data
      * 2: due to laziness, etc. individuals tend not to report all they consume
   * economics is the reason behind calorie consumption
   * food costs, money and preparation time, have been dropping
   * high calorie foods have been much cheaper compared to healthier alternatives
   * as it becomes cheaper, ppl will eat it more
   * low prices translate into larger portions
   * price plays a major role into what and how much we eat
* The Rise of French-Fried Potatoes
   * food processing, preservation, and cooking technologies have allowed more foods to be produced in a central location, and consumed quicker and cheaper
   * 1950’s: The Golden Age of Food Processing
   * the microwave also increased consumption of processed food
* Please Pass the High-Fructose Corn Syrup
   * Farm Board, to provide stability ro agricultural industry
      * programs proposed to raise farm prices by limiting production, buying excess crops in years of overproduction, and guaranteeing prices even in times of economic hardship
      * in reality, has made enormous subsidies to farmers who produce certain crops
   * today, two of the highest subsidized crops are corn and soybeans
   * makes fruit and vegetable prices higher since farmers are growing corn and soybeans
   * high-fructose corn syrup, good for cost and multiple uses, but theory that it doesn’t send an appetite suppressing signal and makes us eat more


The Prescription Opioid and Heroin Crisis: A Public Health Approach to an Epidemic of Addiction by Kolodny 


* Abstract
   * overprescribing of OPRs has led to a sharp increase in the prevalence of opioid addiction, which in turn has been associated with a rise in overdose deaths and heroin use
* Intro
   * addiction is defined as continued use of a drug despite negative consequences 
   * 4 out of 5 current heroin users report that their opioid use began with OPRs
   * appear to be switching to heroin after becoming addicted to OPRs because heroin is less expensive on the black market
* History of the Opioid Addiction in the US
   * main source of the epidemic was iatrogenic morphine addiction, which coincided with the spread of hypodermic medication during 1870–1895
   * nineteenth-century physicians addicted patients—and, not infrequently, themselves—because they had few alternatives to symptomatic treatment
   * revolutions in bacteriology and public health, prescription laws; and admonitions about morphine in the lay and professional literature stemmed the addiction tide
   * after World War II, these epidemics disproportionately affected inner-city minority populations,
* The Sharp Rise in Prescription Opioid Consumption
   * 1986 a paper describing the treatment of 38 chronic pain patients concluded that OPRs could be prescribed safely on a long-term basis
   * acceleration was fueled in large part by the introduction in 1995 of OxyContin, an extended release formulation of oxycodone manufactured by Purdue Pharma
   * prior to the introduction of OxyContin, many physicians were reluctant to prescribe OPRs, but told addiction was less than 1%
      * long-term clinical trials demonstrating the safety and efficacy of OPRs for chronic non-cancer pain have never been conducted
* Reframing the Opioid Crisis As An Epidemic of Addiction
   * evidence suggest that addiction occurring in both medical and nonmedical users, rather than abuse per se, is a key driver of opioid-related morbidity and mortality in medical and nonmedical OPR users
* Opioid Harms Are Not Limited to Nonmedical Users
   * policy makers who focus solely on reducing nonmedical use are failing to appreciate the high opioid-related morbidity and mortality in pain patients receiving OPR prescriptions for medical purposes
   * opioid overdoses appear to occur more frequently in medical OPR users than in young nonmedical users
   * middle-aged women and the elderly are more likely than other groups to visit doctors with complaints of pain
      * white women ages 55–64 have also experienced the largest increase in accidental opioid overdose deaths
* Opioid Addiction is a Key Driver of Morbidity and Mortality
   * accidental opioid overdose is a common cause of death in individuals suffering from opioid addiction 
   * sharp increase in the prevalence of opioid addiction is a key driver of opioid-related morbidity and mortality
* Prevention Strategies
   * interventions should focus on:
   * primary: preventing new cases of opioid addiction
   * secondary prevention: identifying early cases of opioid addiction 
   * tertiary prevention: ensuring access to effective addiction treatment 
* Primary Prevention
   * aim of primary prevention is to reduce the incidence of a disease or condition
   * opioid use disorders appear to be highly prevalent in chronic pain patients treated with OPRs
   * Preventing Addiction Caused by Medical Exposure to OPRS
      * to reduce the incidence of iatrogenic opioid addiction, health care professionals must prescribe opioids more cautiously for both acute and chronic pain
      * OPR prescribing for chronic non-cancer pain increased over the past decade while use of nonopioid analgesics decreased
         * pattern highlights the need for prescriber education that explicitly corrects misperceptions about OPR safety and efficacy
      * providing prescribers with accurate information about opioid risks and benefits could result in more informed risk/benefit appraisals
      * some opioid manufacturers have reformulated OPRs to make them more difficult to misuse through an intranasal or injection route
      * these so-called abuse-deterrent formulations (ADFs) may offer safety advantages over easily snorted and injected OPRs, but they do not render them less addictive
   * Preventing Addiction Caused by Non-Medical Exposure to OPRS
      * adolescents and young adults who experiment with nonmedical use are most likely to obtain OPRs for free from friends or family members who had received a legitimate prescription
      * unused OPRs in medicine chests should be immediately discarded or returned to a pharmacy
      * Individuals who perceive the risk of non-medical OPR use to be low may be more likely to misuse OPRs
      * social marketing campaigns designed to increase perceived harmfulness of OPRs may be an effective prevention strategy
* Secondary Prevention
   * aim of secondary prevention is to screen for a health condition after its onset but before it causes serious complications
   * difficulty of diagnosing opioid addiction in individuals motivated to conceal their condition suggests that prescribers should seek collateral information before prescribing OPRs
   * urine toxicology cannot determine if a patient is taking extra doses or if a patient is using OPRs by an intranasal or injection route
   * doctor shopping: opioid-addicted individuals may receive OPR prescriptions from multiple providers
      * doctor shoppers can be identified through use of state prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs)
   * some doctor shoppers turned away
      * efforts must be made to help these clinicians understand that drug-seeking patients are suffering from the chronic, life-threatening disease of opioid addiction
* Tertiary Prevention
   * strategies involve both therapeutic and rehabilitative measures once a disease is firmly established
   * ensuring that opioid addicted individuals can access effective and affordable opioid addiction treatment.
   * Opioid Addiction Treatment
      * treatment of opioid addiction includes pharmacotherapies and psychosocial approaches, including residential treatment, mutual-help programs
      * psychosocial opioid addiction treatment approaches show value and are an important treatment option 
   * Harm-Reduction Approaches
      * tertiary prevention strategies also include harm-reduction approaches to improving health outcomes and reducing overdose deaths
      * 1990s, syringe exchange programs began distributing naloxone to injection drug users for the purpose of rescuing peers
* Conclusion
   * efforts must be made to reduce the incidence of opioid addiction, identify cases early, and ensure access to effective treatment.


Class Notes (9/5): Sociological Approaches to Health


* WHO
   * health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well being
      * not merely the absence of disease or infirmity 
* Global Approaches to Health
   * medical model: defined as the absence of illness/disease
      * prevalent model in US and industrialized nations
      * skewed toward curative activities
      * more expensive, band-aid
   * preventative model: focus on preventing illness, rather than curing illness and disease
* Measuring Health
   * mortality = death
      * easier to define and measure
      * exception is immigrant groups
         * salmon bias hypothesis, if can will return back home if sick
   * morbidity = illness (physical and mental)
      * harder to measure accurately bc reports are inaccurate, missing ppl’s true information bc access to healthcare, etc.
* Changes in US Mortality
   * leading causes of death 1900
      * influenza, TB, pneumonia
   * leading causes of death now
      * heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases 
* Why Social Scientists Study Health Pt.1
* sociologists study health bc lifestyle is affected by the social environment
      * health is the ultimate indicator of inequality
      * not evenly distributed in society
      * rooted in social causes
      * does not dismiss biology and genetics 
* Sociological Approach vs. Other Disciplines
   * sociologists: focus on factors more distance from the outcome (social class, gender) - fundamental causes
   * epidemiologist: focus on proximal factors (diet, exercise, smoking)
   * medical doctors; tend to focus on biological factors (cholesterol levels)
* Why Social Scientists Study Health Pt.2
   * social environment influences health
      * health isn’t an individual issue or a societal problem
   * evidence
      * example #1: obesity
      * example #2: opioid crisis 
   * key theme: tension between the goals of for-profit private organizations (food and pharma industries) and the ability and desire for gov regulation of public health 
* Why Care About These Trends
   * diabetes                - poor mental health                - 
   * hypertension                - heart disease                - metabolic syndrome
* What Has Contributed to These Trends?
   * unhealthy food is cheaper
      * since 1978, food prices have dropped by 38%
      * greatest drops are for calorie dense foods
      * prices for healthy foods have gone up
   * sedentary life is easier now
   * massive economic changes
      * women in the workforce, longer commutes, not enough to cook or teach about health
   * changes in social and cultural norms
      * fast food culture, Sundays in the South
   * changes in food and marketing
      * targeting children, different ingredients
* Food Industry
   * $35 billion annually in advertising
      * 70% on non-nutritious foods
      * 2% on fruits, veggies, grains
      * heavily marketed to kids 
* Where It Began
   * late 1990s, pharmaceutical companies encouraged doctors to prescribe opioid pain relievers
   * claimed patients wouldn’t become addicted
   * pharma companies pushed major marketing campaigns including promo videos
   * doctors began widely prescribing the medications and later discovered their addictive nature
* In 2015
   * 2 million ppl had a substance use disorder related to prescription opioids
   * 591,000 people had a heroin use disorder
   * 33,000_ ppl died from opioid overdose (out of 52,000 total overdoses)
   * preliminary evidence from 2016: 59,000-65,000 died from overdoses 
   * middle-age white men
      * have insurance, money to get prescription drugs to get addicted in the first place
* Opioid as a Gateway to Heroin
   * 21-29% of patients given an opioid prescription for chronic pain misuse them
   * 4-6% who misuse prescription opioids transition to heroin
   * 75% of heroin users first misused prescription opioids 
Changing Patterns in U.S. Immigration and Population: Immigrants Slow Population Decline in Many Counties by Pew Report 2014
* U.S. Census Bureau projects that net international migration to the United States will become the primary driver of the nation’s population growth between 2027 and 2038
* immigrants have moved beyond traditional gateways
   * growth in the foreign-born population has extended beyond traditional gateways—such as California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, and Texas—into other areas of the United States, especially the Southeast and the Pacific Northwest
* native-born population has declined in Middle America
   * while the foreign-born population was increasing and dispersing, the native-born population was declining in certain areas of the country
* immigration has driven population growth in the Sun Belt, Pacific Northwest, and Mountain States
   * areas where the overall population has increased and how the foreign-born population has contributed to that growth
   * increases in the number of immigrants have driven overall growth in many counties, particularly in the South and West
* immigration has slowed population declines in Middle America
   * changes in foreign- and native-born populations and highlights areas where the growth of the foreign-born population has slowed overall decline and sometimes has overcome native-born losses for a net population gain
* immigrants have the potential to offset population decline in some areas of the country, immigrants can also compensate for the aging of the native-born population
* foreign born: an individual who was not a U.S. citizen at birth or who was born outside the United States, Puerto Rico, or other U.S. territories and whose parents are not U.S. citizens
* native born: those who are U.S. citizens at birth, namely people born in the United States, Puerto Rico, or other U.S. territories and those born abroad to at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen
* total population: throughout this brief, “total” or “overall” population refers to the adult population 18 years and older
* impact of immigration on demographic change is vital to analyzing the economic and fiscal effect immigrants have on states and localities










Social Conditions as Fundamental Causes of Disease by Phelan + Link
* Intro
   * we question the emphasis on such individually-based risk factors and argue that greater attention must be paid to basic social conditions if health reform is to have its maximum effect in the time ahead
      * individually-based risk factors must be contextualized, by examining what puts people at risk of risks, if we are to craft effective interventions and improve the nation's health
      * social factors such as socioeconomic status and social support are likely "fundamental causes" of disease that, because they embody access to important resources, affect multiple disease outcomes through multiple mechanisms, and consequently maintain an association with disease even when intervening mechanisms change
   * this focus on proximate risk factors, potentially controllable at the individual level, resonates with the value and belief systems of Western culture that emphasize both the ability of the individual to control his or her personal fate and the importance of doing so
* Evidence Linking Social Conditions to Disease
   * social conditions as factors that involve a person's relationships to other people
   * one approach uses quasi-experimental strategies which involve locating conditions under which alternative explanations make different predictions about observable facts
   * one approach where medical sociologists and social epidemiologists identify social risk factors that cannot reasonably be conceived as having been caused by an individual's illness condition
   * one approach is longitudinal designs
      * some longitudinal studies do not allow clear inferences about time order and therefore do not provide the definitive evidence about causality that is sometimes attributed to them
   * the common mechanism underlying low power and role overload is a decreased sense of personal control, which is in turn related to symptoms of anxiety and depression
   * we have described two characterizations of social conditions as causes of disease that either advertently or inadvertently downplay their importance
      * outright declaration that social factors are only proxies for true causes
      * the view that social factors serve as starting points whose main function is to point the direction to more proximal risk factors
      * sharp issue with both of these characterizations
* Contextualizing Risk Factors
   * use an interpretive framework to understand why people come to be exposed to risk or protective factors
   * determine the social conditions under which individual risk factors are related to disease
   * while the current approach to the problem focuses on the individual, it can readily be seen that economic and political forces shape individuals' exposure to this risk
   * efforts to reduce risk by changing behavior may be hopelessly ineffective if there is no clear understanding of the process that leads to exposure
* Fundamental Causes
   * medical sociologists and social epidemiologists need to take as their task the identification and thorough consideration of social conditions that are what we term "fundamental causes" of disease
   * because a fundamental cause involves access to broadly serviceable resources, it influences (1) multiple risk factors and (2) multiple disease outcomes
   * if one genuinely wants to alter the effects of a fundamental cause, one must address the fundamental cause itself
   * medical sociologists and social epidemiologists need to be careful in interpreting and communicating the meaning of research involving social factors, intervening mechanisms, and disease
   * to understand associations between fundamental causes and disease, medical sociologists need to examine the broader determinants of the resources that fundamental causes entail
* Policy Implications
   *  "personal policy" changes, individual changes
      * without understanding the social conditions that expose people to individually-based risk factors, interventions will fail more often than they should
      * some social conditions are fundamental causes of disease and as such cannot be effectively addressed by re-adjusting the individually-based mechanisms that appear to link them to disease in a given context
   * three general criteria that policymakers should use in evaluating whether to commit funds to a proposed health intervention
      * consistent with the idea of contextualizing risk factors, policymakers should require that all interventions seeking to change individual risk profiles contain an analysis of factors that put people at risk of risks
      * consistent with the concept of fundamental causes, health policymakers should consider whether a proposed intervention will have an impact on just one disease or whether, because of its influence on a fundamental cause, it will affect many diseases
      * health policymakers concerned with broad social conditions as causes of disease should regard with skepticism interventions that focus only on intervening variables but claim to address the broader social condition

* Intro
   * immigrants and refugees bring diverse epidemiological profiles based on different environments and of diseases 
* Cultural Competence

      * CAM: complementary and alternative medicine
* Alternative Medical Systems
   * alternative medical systems: homeopathic medicine and naturopathic medicine
* Mind-Body Interventions
   * uses a variety of techniques designed to enhance the mind’s capacity to affect bodily function and symptoms
      * ex: meditation, prayer, etc.
* Biologically Based Therapies
   * use substances found in nature, such as herbs, foods, and vitamins
      * ex: herbal products, dietary supplements
* Manipulative and Body-Based Methods
   * use of energy fields in the body that are manipulated by the practitioner
* Energy Therapies
   * CAM emphasizes addressing proximal, immediate causes of illness, distal causation
   * prevention of disease important to CAM
   * emphasizes holiness or dealing w/ all aspects of patient’s life
   * CAM, wants to get to WHO’s definition of health: state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not just absence of disease or infirmity
   * CAM staff, “gatekeepers” for public health intervention
* Culture-Bound Syndromes
   * CBS, denotes recurrent, locality, specific patterns of aberrant behavior and troubling experience that may be linked to a particular DSM-IV diagnostic
* Culture and the Life Cycle
   * life cycle course provides a template from which to view health and illness cross-culturally
* Pregnancy and Childbirth
   * culture can have a profound effect on the health of an unborn child
   * childbirth in the West is seen as more medical than as a human process
* Infancy and Childhood
   * Third world, “social birth” when membership in the society is formalized
   * childcare given to older siblings bc large families
   * all cultures have some way to demarcate social transition from childhood to adulthood
   * rites of passage surrounding puberty
      * separation, transition, incorporation
* Menstruation and Menopause
   * women in non-Western societies w/o access to birth control menstruate less due to frequent pregnancies and length breastfeeding
* End of Life
   * rituals during death and dying are essential for human societies to deal w/ loss and need to be respected by host institutions to which refugees and immigrants interact
Refugee and Immigrant Health: Ch. 2
* Immigrant Types: Economic Immigrants
   * those who want to pursue a better economic opportunity
   * immigrant visas: temporary residence
   * nonimmigrant visas: permanent residence
* Immigrant Types: Refugees
   * any person outside any country of such person’s nationality, who is unwilling or unable to return, bc of persecution or well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership, political opinion
   * pushed instead of pulled for immigration
      * some integrate into their first asylum country, but rare
         * more often, when displaced numbers are too large, humanitarian relief orgs come and create refugee camps
      * repatriation of refugees WHEN conditions change
      * resettlement to a third country, or secondary asylum
   * once the refugee flees, three different “durable solutions”
   * Resettlement
      * Same resettlement policy goal: encouragement of assimilation and economic self-sufficiency 
      * Volag monies ad programs aren’t sufficient to ensure full assimilation for refugees
      * Diversity within refugee groups: first groups more privileged than second waves
* Immigrant Types: Asylum-Seekers and Asylees
   * an individual already in a Western country who is in the process of petitioning for permission to remain permanently bc of a claim of persecution in the country of origin
   * if denied, can be deported
* Victims of Trafficking (VOT)
   * number of ppl moved across borders through schemes of indentured work, coercion and deception, unlawful payment
* Future of Refugee Resettlement
   * fewer refugees arriving legally in the West as screening is more rigorous and time-consuming than in the past
   * fewer refugees or immigrants are arriving illegally in the West as border security is more rigorous than in the past
      * large numbers of illegal refugees and immigrants do cross to join large numbers already present
   * vast number of refugees continue to flee war, persecution, famine, and other man-made and natural disasters
Refugee and Immigrant Health: Ch. 3
* Intro
   * first point of contact w/ health care for refugees is usually at emergency care at temporary border refugee camp in country of first asylum
   * services usually provided by NGOs
   * most common first point of contact:
      * refugee resettlement agencies
      * gov refugee transit centers
   * basic screening and referral or treatment:
      * identify communicable diseases that are public health risks
      * eliminate health-related barriers to successful adaption
   * most undocumented immigrants aren’t screened, delayed contact w/ healthcare system
* Level 1: Acute Phase
   * attracts the most concern bc of communicable nature of illnesses
   * public health threat
   * parasitism among refugee groups
* Level 2: Transition
   * usually children’s needs are met, then adults will come forward seeking care
   * some ask for prescription drugs to send back home to family, doctor shopping
   * communicable diseases more prevalent in first stage, but chronic illnesses begin to develop here
* Level 3: Chronic
   * 10+ years after resettlement, most likely to live in isolated enclaves, little access to health/social services, unable to speak or write in host language, poor health/SES
   * assimilated, educated, and employed immigrants are unlikely to enter this phase
   * factors to the chronic state:
      * high and often sustained levels of trauma
      * greater number of resettlement stressors
      * financial stress
   * chronic state of refugee status/poor health is lived out or expressed in several ways:
      * traditional family structures break down
      * segments of the population gain assimilation/move into middle working class while others go into “neither here nor there” world of ethnic ghetto
      * untreated chronic health problems accumulate, takes a toll
   * complexities of cultural isolation and barriers to healthcare access
      * eventually loses contact w/ healthcare staff
   * increases in prevalence of self-abusive behaviors (alcohol, etc.)
* Immigrants
   * health status varies w/ circumstances of immigration
   * “a sadness from losing their sense of place”

Immigrant America: Ch. 2
Compared to Whom? Subjective Social Status, Self-rated Health, and Referent Group Sensitivity in a Diverse US Sample by Wolff
* research has show that how people perceive their position in the social hierarchy, is significantly associated with multiple health outcomes
* scholars have suggested that individuals may prefer to make comparisons to those who share similar characteristics to themselves
* social status indicators are comprised of different types of measures, some assessing actual economic resources and others capturing prestige-related characteristics
* there has been little empirical analysis assessing the health impact of comparing oneself to one referent group over another
* we hypothesized that there would be significant racial/ethnic differences in the relationship between SSS and self-rated health, particularly when using the distal referent group of others in American society
* ratio tests indicate that an SSS measure using the more distal referent group, others in American society, appears to have a stronger association with self-rated health than measures using other referent groups and also provides the most parsimonious model
* the relationship between SSS and self-rated health was strongest with this national comparison and also did not differ by race/ethnicity
* how people perceive their subjective social position is strongly predictive of their self-rated health status


Not Everyone Chosen: Segmented Assimilation
* assimilation has different outcomes
* second generation
   * undergoing a process of segmented assimilation: outcomes vary across immigrant minorities and where rapid integration and acceptance into the American mainstream represent just one possible alternative
* factors
   * history of the immigrant first generation
   * pace of acculturation among parents and children and its bearing on normative integration
   * barriers, cultural and economic, confronted by second gen youth in their quest for successful adaptation
   * the family and community resources for confronting these barriers
* How Immigrants Are Received: Modes of Incorporation and Their Consequences
   * immigrants differ along three dimensions
      * individual features (age, education, English, wealth)
      * social environment that receives them, policies of the gov, attitudes of the native population, size and presence of the co-ethnic community
      * family structure
* Acculturation and Role Reversal
   * children become the parent’s parents, dependent on children’s knowledge of the system
   * rates in which the parents and children assimilate can be different
   * dissonant acculturation: children’s learning of English and American ways and simultaneous loss of the immigrant culture oustrip their parents’
      * undercuts parental authorities and places children at risk
   * consonant acculturation: opposite, learning process and gradual abandonment of the home language and culture occur at the same pace, parents can monitor it
      * doesn’t guarantee success, can be undermined by discrimination
   * selective acculturation: learning process of both generations is embedded in the co-ethnic community to slow down the cultural shift and promote partial retention of the parents’ home language and norms
      * most solid basis for preservation of parental authority
* Where They Grow Up: Challenges to the Second-Gen Adaptation
   * to what segment of society will immigrants assimilate
   * three major challenges to education attainment/career success for children of immigrants
      * racial discrimination
      * bifurcation of the US labor market and growing inequality
      * consolidation of a marginalized population in the inner society
   * Counterculture
      * downward assimilation, opposite of upward mobility and assimilation
* Confronting the Challenge: Immigrant Social Capital
   * resources: those that provide access to economic goods and job opportunities and those that reinforce parental normative controls
   * parents w/ higher social capital:
      * more info on opportunities and pitfalls
      * can earn higher incomes to access strategic goods
   * The Immigrant Community
      * social capital provides key resources in confronting obstacles to successful adaptation
         * increases economic opportunities
         * strong ethnic communities enforce norms against divorce
            * help reinforce parental authority
when parental expectations are reinforced by others in the community, probability of selective acculturation is enhanced 
Immigrant Health: Selectivity and Acculturation by Jasso
* the average healthiness of the original immigrants, the diversity in health status among immigrants, the subsequent health trajectories following immigration both over immigrants lifetime and that of their descendents all combine to produce the ethnic health disparities we observe at any point in time
* two measures of health outcomes
   * self-reports of general health status
   * prevalence rates of important chronic conditions
* self-reports: the foreign-born population in the United States appears to be in slightly worse health than the native-born are
* prevalence rates: the foreign born have much lower rates of chronic conditions than the native-born do
* the immigrants who arrive in any year may also be influenced by forces unique to that year
* no matter what duration since immigration is examined, prevalence rates among immigrants are much less than those for the US born for chronic conditions
* since the health of US native-born is so far in excess of those in most migrant sending countries, if migrants to the US have better health than the US native-born they surely have better health than those who stayed in the sending countries
* the basic notion is that if disease rates change when you move from one place to another, it is indicative of a role for environmental factors
* two perennial themes to the literature on migration and health outcomes
   * the nature of the health selectivity of international migrants
   * the impact of migration on the subsequent health trajectory of migrants
* when migration costs are greater, migrants must be either more skilled or harder workers or both
* countries with higher skill prices will also send fewer migrants to the US, but once again these migrants should be more selective on labor effort or skill
* migration rates will increase when rates of skill transferability are higher, but migrants who do come will be of lower skill or work effort
* dominant empirical conclusion appears to be that trajectories of immigrant health are less positive than they would have been if they had not migrated
* skill and health go together for two reasons.
   * those immigrants with more skill have higher incomes and thus can “purchase” better health, a proposition we will test directly based on the change in income of the immigrants
   * those who tend to invest in human capital do so with respect to both investments in health and in labor market skills
* countries generally not located at great distances from the U.S. have lower U.S. immigration barriers or costs and should, given skill prices, be disproportionately sending countries for low-skill and less healthy immigrants
* health selection- the propensity of immigrants to be much healthier than a representative person in the sending country- is a quantitatively important phenomenon that is fundamental to understanding the most basic patterns that emerge about immigrant health
Class Notes (9/19): Theories on Immigration and Health
* Key Questions on Immigration and Health
   * Are determinants of health comparable across national origin subgroups?
      * No, different statuses, languages, etc. affect determinants of health
   * Are determinants of immigrant health comparable to the native born?
      * All native born have come from mostly Western European origins. 
   * How does the immigration experience affect assimilation?
      * Context in sending and receiving country (welcome, stable economy, etc.)
* Theories on Immigrant Assimilation
   * health is just one of many assimilation outcomes
   * three key factors determine degree and ease of assimilation
      * individual traits (education, income, skills, language)
      * social environment: sending and receiving country
         * government policies (exclusion, acceptance, encouragement)
         * attitude of native-born population (e.g. discrimination)
         * presence of co-ethnics
      * family structure
* What We Know About Immigrant Health
   * populations from diverse world regions
   * on average, they arrive healthier than US-born
   * on average, they lose health advantage over time
   * but patterns vary across immigrant groups
* Explanations
   * Why do immigrants arrive healthy?
      * selective migration
      * cultural buffering, social support network
      * lifestyle, at-risk behaviors are less
   * Why happens over time with assimilation?
      * advantage erodes w/ longer US residence
         * discrimination 
         * regression to the mean (you get older, man)
      * increased risk-taking behaviors (poor diet)
      * loss of protective factors (family support)
* Other Explanations
   * problems w/ research questions
      * morbidity (cultural biases in self-reports)
         * questions may not be valid translated, may not mean the same thing
      * mortality (salmon hypothesis) JUMP JUMP MF
   * cross-sectional data
      * access to care increases w/ time
      * newer immigrants may not have access
      * reference group changes over time, self-reports are relative to others
      * not Americanization, per se
* Social Status and Health
   * social status in origin and arrival
   * social status = fundamental cause of health

The Hispanic Health Paradox: New Evidence From Longitudinal Data on Second and Third-Generation Birth Outcomes by Giuntella


* second-generation children of Mexican and Cuban origin have better birth outcomes than children of US-born white women
* children of Puerto Rican origin have instead worse birth outcomes
* advantage observed among second-generation Hispanics erodes substantially in the third generation but third-generation Mexicans retain some of it
Mexican Immigrants in the US by Zong and Batalova 
* four main stages of Mexican immigration
   * WWII, agricultural workers recruited for private labor contractors
   * Bracero Program, mostly agricultural workers
   * 1965 Immigration Act, largely unauthorized wave after Bracero was terminated that happened after the act ended national origin quotas and imposed the first numerical limits on Mexico and other LA countries
      * mostly male, seasonal farm laborers who traveled back and forth
   * Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), legalized close to 3 million unauthorized migrants in return for tougher border enforcement and penalties for American employers who hired unauthorized workers
* Reasons for decreasing Mexican immigration to the US
   * Great Recession
   * improved educational and economic opportunities in Mexico
   * tougher border enforcement
* Mexicans 
   * represent the largest unauthorized immigrant group in the US
   * less likely to be proficient in English or speak it at home than overall US foreign-born populations
   * lower educational attainment compared to foreign and native born
   * younger than overall US immigrant population but older than the native born
   * participate in labor force at slightly higher rate than overall immigrant and native born in mostly service occupations
   * lower incomes compared to foreign and native
   * poverty rate also higher than both
   * 11.6 Mexican immigrants in 2013, 28% of total US foreign born population
   * majority who became lawful permanent residents were immediate relatives or held family-sponsored preference visas
   * most in 2013 were much more likely to be uninsured than both
Does Selective Migration Explain the Hispanic Paradox? A Comparative Analysis of Mexicans in the U.S. and Mexico by Bostean
* Two main explanations have come to dominate the research on this epidemiologic ‘‘Hispanic paradox’’ 
   * Latino health is protected by cultural factors, such as a traditional diet and familial support, that deteriorate with acculturation
   * migrants are selected by health status, with healthier people immigrating to the U.S. and unhealthy people emigrating from the U.S
   * ‘‘Healthy migrant’’ hypothesis: Mexican immigrants in the U.S. are healthier than non-migrants in Mexico
   * ‘‘Salmon-bias’’ hypothesis: return-migrants (those who migrated to the U.S. and subsequently returned to Mexico) are less healthy than Mexican immigrants in the U.S
   * however, selection mechanisms may vary for younger and older adults since both the likelihood of emigrating from Mexico, and that of returning to Mexico vary with age
      * young working-age adults whose reasons for migrating are usually financial and likely quite different from those of older adults, who may migrate to accompany family members; therefore, results from studies on older adults may not be generalizable to younger migrants
   * this finding corroborates previous research suggesting that acculturation has deleterious effects on immigrant health
   * this study’s findings provided support for both a healthy migrant effect and salmon-bias for activity limitation, but these selection effects did not appear relevant in self-rated health or chronic conditions
   * plausible explanation is that having an activity limitation hinders migration to the United States among those in Mexico, but encourages Mexicans in the U.S. to re-emigrate back to Mexico
   * migrants are positively selected in some health aspects, negatively selected in others, and in yet other health outcomes, there is no selection effect
   * selective migration plays a role in explaining some of U.S. Latinos’ health outcomes, but is not the only explanation and does not account for the Paradox
Gender and National Origin Differences in Healthcare Utilization Among U.S. Immigrants from Mexico, China, and India by Read and Smith
* Chinese immigrants are less likely than Mexican and Indian immigrants to have seen a doctor in the past year, a finding that is largely driven by a lack of health insurance
* female immigrants are more likely than males to have done so, despite having fewer resources that enable access to care (e.g. income, English proficiency)
* relationship between gender and utilization is moderated by English language proficiency: among immigrants with low levels of proficiency, women are significantly more likely than men to have seen a doctor in the past year, while no difference exists between men and women who are proficient in English
   * this pattern is most evident among Mexican, and to a lesser extent, Indian immigrants
* utilization is different from access because it gauges the likelihood and frequency of individuals coming into contact with the healthcare system
   * important concept because many health conditions require a medical diagnosis for appropriate treatment, such as hypertension or diabetes
* immigrant women are more likely than immigrant men to arrive on family reunification visas, less likely to be employed once in the U.S., and earn less when they are employed
Health Assimilation among Hispanic Immigrants in the United States: The Impact of Ignoring Arrival-cohort Effects by Hamilton
* health (i.e., self-rated health) of Hispanic immigrants varies by both arrival cohort and U.S. tenure for immigrants hailing from most of the primary sending countries/regions of Hispanic immigrants
* omitting arrival cohort measures from health assimilation models may result in overestimates of the degree of downward health assimilation experienced by Hispanic immigrants.
* more recent immigrant arrival cohorts have more favorable initial health profiles
   * this pattern could reflect changes in U.S. immigration laws that negatively affected the flow of less healthy immigrants to the United States, particularly immigrants from Mexico and Central America
* earlier immigrants probably had lesser health to BEGIN with compared to modern day immigrant groups
Class Notes (9/26): Hispanic Immigrants 
* Hispanic population 17.6% or 55 million 
* Mexican Population
   * 32 million
   * 64% are US born
   * 36% foreign born
      * 6 million legal
      * 5.6 million illegal
* US Immigration Policies
   * Bracero Program (1942-1964)
      * manual laborer worker program that paid 30 cents/hour
   * 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act
      * imposed numerical limits on Mexican immigrants
   * IRCA 1986
      * toughened border security and increased penalties
* Result of Historical Policies?
   * Hispanics have high employment rates, but:
      * low English proficiency
      * low educational attainment
      * low social class status
      * high rates of poverty
* Poverty
   * pre-tax income, doesn’t vary geographically
   * in 2015, % in poverty
      * 13.2% of Americans (43.1 million)
   * cost of childcare in NC: 1 child, $16,000
      * threshold: single parent w/ one child, $19,000
* Mechanisms Linking Low Status to Health: Stress
   * worse economic conditions
      * less likely to be working, and working-full time
      * less subjectively rewarding jobs and more $$
   * few social-psychological resources
      * less sense of control over life and health status
      * lower levels of social support
   * worse health behaviors
      * more smoking, less exercise, fewer health checkups
* How Does Stress Get “In” the Body?
   * cortisol and epinephrine (adrenaline), have both protective and damaging effects on the body
   * four conditions that lead to allostatic load
      * repeated frequency of stress response to multiple novel stressors
      * failure to habituate to repeated stressors of the same kind
      * failure to turn off each stress response in a timely manner due to delayed shut down
      * inadequate response that leads to compensatory hyperactivity of other mediators
* Discussion
   * men who picked men doctors, disclosed less information
   * Chinese, Eastern medicine and different ideas of healthcare system (hospital = death)
Allostatic Load in Foreign-Born and US-Born Blacks by Doamekpor and Dinwiddie
* allostatic load accounts for the cumulative impact of physiological responses to acute, chronic, or long-term psychosocial stressors generated by social conditions that continuously activate hormonal responses to stressful conditions
* for foreign-born Blacks, length of stay and age were powerful predictors of allostatic load scores
* for older US-born Blacks and those who were widowed, divorced, or separated, the risk of high allostatic load was greater
* foreign-born Blacks have a health advantage in allostatic load
* we found that time in the United States was a significant predictor of high allostatic load scores for foreign-born Blacks residing in the United States
* increased allostatic load was associated with increased age because cumulative adversity over the lifespan is associated with multisystem dysregulation
* research that suggests African immigrants’ superior health may be related to the fact that they are on average more highly educated than are US-born Blacks and Whites
* Caribbean and African immigrants have worse health over time because they have higher levels of psychological stress related to immigration and adjusting to new socio-cultural environment
* the impact of exposure to racism in the United States may be particularly stressful for immigrants from regions of the world where they were a demographic majority
Health Among Black Children by Maternal and Child Nativity by Hendi, Mehta, Elo
* children of foreign-born mothers were healthier across all 5 outcomes than were children of US-born mothers
* among children of foreign-born mothers, US-born children performed worse on all health outcomes than children born abroad
* African-origin children had the most favorable health profile
* longer duration of US residence among foreign-born mothers was associated with poorer child health
* maternal educational attainment and other socio-demographic characteristics did little to explain these differences
* there was a gradient such that children of US-born mothers fared worse than children of mothers born in Latin America or the Caribbean, who in turn fared worse than children of African-born mothers
* foreign-born children have significantly better health outcomes than US-born children, regardless of the nativity of the mother
* children of African-born mothers are generally healthier than children of Latin American-Caribbean born mothers, differences that could not be explained by the mother’s duration of US residence
* children of US-born mothers are more than twice as likely as children of African-born mothers to have been diagnosed with asthma
   * children of Latin American---Caribbean-born mothers, although significantly less likely to be diagnosed than children of US-born mothers, are nevertheless significantly more likely to be diagnosed with asthma than children of African-born mothers
   * similar patterns are observed for the child’s general health status, missed school days, activity limitations, and skin and respiratory allergies
* the lingering health advantage of children of migrants suggests that protective cultural traits from the cultures of origin (cultural buffering) may also play a role
* advantaged health patterns of African-origin children compared with Latin American---Caribbean-origin children, which were not explained by differences in duration of US residence, may be due to the greater selectivity of the African-born mothers (visa categories too)
   * African migration streams are more recent, and the distance is far greater for migrants from Africa than for those from Latin America and the Caribbean
   * among immigrant subgroups in the United States, African immigrants are the healthiest relative to people in the country of origin
Differing Birth Weight Among Infants of US Born Blacks, African-Born Blacks, and US Born Whites by David and Collins
* the rate of low birth weight in infants of African-born black women (3.6 percent) was closer to the rate in infants of U.S.- born white women (2.4 percent), and the rate in infants of U.S.-born black women remained high (7.5 percent)
* the birth-weight patterns of infants of African-born black women and U.S.-born white women are more closely related to one another than to the birth weights of infants of U.S.-born black women
* African-born black women delivered the highest proportion of infants who were their mothers’ fourth or subsequent children and had the highest proportion of previous fetal and infant deaths
* U.S.-born black women were the youngest, the least likely to be married, the least well educated, and the most likely to have received prenatal care late or not at all
* white women surpassed both groups of black women with regard to only one risk factor — primigravidity, first time being pregnant
* these data provide some evidence against the theory that there is a genetic basis for the disparity between white and black women born in the United States in the mean birth weights of their infants
* racial differences in birth weight persist independently of numerous social and economic risk factors
* if genetics played a prominent part in determining black–white differences in birth weight, the infants of the African-born black women should have had lower birth weights than those of the U.S.-born black women 
* found the opposite: regardless of socioeconomic status, the infants of black women born in Africa weighed more than the infants of comparable black women born in the United States
Discrimination and Health by Krieger
* racial/ethnic disparities often explain US racial/ethnic inequalities in health
* ecosocial theory: asks how we incorporate biologically, from conception to death, our social experiences and express this embodiment in population patterns of health, disease, and well-being 
   * draws attention to why and how societal conditions daily produce population distributions of health
   * posits how we develop, grow, age, ail, and die necessarily reflects a constant interplay of our intertwined and inseparable social and biological history
* types of discrimination: race/ethnic, gender, sexuality, disability, age, class
* Discrimination
   * to make an adverse distinction, to distinguish unfavorably from others
   * de jure: mandated by law, i.e. Jim Crow
   * de facto: without legal basis but sanctioned by custom/practice i.e. underrepresentation of marginalized groups
   * all means of expressing and institutionalizing social relationships of dominance and oppression
   * types
      * legal
      * illegal
      * overt
      * covert
      * institutional (organizational): discriminatory policies or practices carried out by state or non-state institutions
      * structural (systemic): totality of ways in which societies foster discrimination
      * interpersonal (individual): directly perceived discriminatory interactions between individuals 
* Patterns of Discrimination
   * experience discrimination in the present
   * experience multiple forms of discrimination
   * different types can occur in about every facet of public and private life
      * everyday discrimination, covert but always present
   * while some experiences of discrimination may be interpersonal and obvious, others maybe be institutional and invisible
   * US racial attitudes believe that discrimination is a thing of the past
* Approaches to Quantifying Health Effects of Discrimination
   * indirectly (individual): examine whether known risk factors explain differences in health outcomes between members of dominant and subordinate groups; if not, infer discrimination may contribute to residual differences
   * directly (self-reports): among subordinate groups, examine whether self-reported experiences of discrimination are associated w/ specific health outcomes
   * institutional (population level): among subordinate groups, examine whether group-level measures of discrimination are associated w/ population rates of health outcome
   * investigating health outcomes of groups since discrimination itself is hard to measure
* “personal/group” discrimination discrepancy: ppl typically report perceiving greater discrimination directed towards their group rather than to themselves
* factors why individuals reporting difference experiences of discrimination even when subjected to same “exposure”
   * internalized oppression: members internalize negative views of dominant culture and accept their status and unfair treatment as “deserved”/non-discriminatory
   * some may see discrimination as “positive traits” attributed to them by the dominant group
   * ppl consciously or subconsciously shape answers to be “socially acceptable” and may also vary in finding it helpful or distressing to speak about problems
   * Individuals may exaggerate experiences of discrimination to avoid blaming themselves for failure
* four research strategies that could be useful
   * employ qualitative interviews
   * build on new research about people’s physiologic response to adverse stimuli pertaining to the types of discrimination being studied
   * use implicit measures designed to circumvent biases
   * include questions assessing identity formation, political consciousness, stigma, and internalized oppression
* population level measures of discrimination could perhaps be meaningfully combined w/ individual-level measures to yield even more informative analyses of health consequences of discrimination
* pathways that discrimination can affect health
   * economic and social deprivation
   * toxic substances and hazardous conditions
   * socially inflicted trauma
   * targeted marketing of legal and illegal psychoactive substances and other commodities
   * inadequate healthcare
* pathway #1: residential segregation and occupational segregation lead to greater economic deprivation
* pathway #2: residential segregation increases risk of exposure to lead among African Americans via contaminated soil, lead, etc.
* pathway #3: perceiving or anticipating racial discrimination provokes fear and anger; physiology of fear mobilizes lipids and glucose to increase energy supplies and sensory vigilance and also produces transient elevations in blood pressure, allostatic load
* pathway #4: targeted marketing of high-alcohol content beverages to black communities increases likelihood of harmful use of alcohol, etc.
pathway #5: poorer detection and clinical management of hypertension among black communities increases risk of uncontrolled hypertension due to insufficient medical care
Racial Context, Black Immigration and the U.S. Black/White Health Disparity by Read
   * compared to U.S.-born blacks, black immigrants from minority white (Africa, South America) and racially mixed (West Indies) regions have superior health, while those from majority white (Europe) regions fare no better
   * understanding the mechanisms in the United States – racial context – that worsen the health and well-being of black Americans, foreign and native-born alike
   * Introduction
   * blacks have the highest rates of morbidity and mortality for almost all diseases, highest disability rates, shortest life expectancies, least access to health care, and startlingly low rates of the use of modern technology in their treatment
   * three major unknowns in our knowledge about the health of black immigrants
   * whether the immigrant advantage applies to blacks uniformly or varies by region of birth
   * whether the immigrant advantage is due to selectivity, sociodemographic factors, cultural characteristics, or other factors
   * whether the black immigrant advantage follows the same path as other groups and erodes over time
   * Theorizing Black Immigrant Health
   * studies consistently document that immigrants enjoy better health outcomes than the comparable U.S.-born population, whether health status is conceptualized in terms of morbidity or mortality
   * with increased duration in the United States, the advantage erodes as a result of increased risk-taking behavior, such as poor diet and exercise, and loss of protective factors, such as family support and cultural orientation
   * differences in migration circumstances, human and social capital, context of reception, and lifestyle characteristics help explain these patterns
   * socioeconomic status fails to explain the entire racial gap in health – blacks have worse health than whites at comparable levels of education and income, an indication that race plays a larger role than socioeconomic status
   * socioeconomic status does not explain the effects of race, but rather, race is causally prior to socioeconomic status and specifies one’s socioeconomic position
   * racism is a powerful determinant of health status because it operates on many different levels: by limiting access to socio-economic goods through residential segregation, which in turn determines access to education and employment opportunities
   * Toward an Alternative Explanation: Racial Context of Origin
   * relative economic success of black immigrants compared to U.S.-born blacks was once considered evidence of a “black success story,” not unlike the model minority image of Asian immigrants
   * Caribbean blacks are believed to benefit from favorable perceptions that white employers have about them, relative to U.S.-born blacks, whereas African immigrants do not appear to have the same advantage
   * Caribbean immigrants in New York City and found that they are more likely to be employed, work more hours, and have higher incomes than U.S.-born blacks
   * since these immigrants come from cultures in which blacks are the majority, they have accumulated more social and cultural capital than U.S.-born blacks
   * have higher self-esteem, are more prepared to resist efforts to discriminate against them, and their accents allow them to be perceived by others as different from U.S.-born blacks
   * blacks living in majority white contexts typically suffer esteem issues, the lower end of the socioeconomic ladder, and the receiving end of individual- and structural-level racism
   * social epidemiologists have shown that early life experiences, especially sub-desirable ones, become permanently embedded and have negative consequences in all phases of human development
   * for racial minorities, the conflict between identity and the developing reality of adulthood – that one’s aspirations are often unachievable because of one’s racial category – has negative consequences for both physical and mental health
   * Hypotheses for Black Immigrant Health
   * African-born blacks comprise 16 percent of the U.S. foreign-born black population and are considerably more educated than other black immigrant groups
   * African immigrants are considerably more likely than other black immigrants to migrate through diversity programs and much less likely to be admitted on the basis of family-sponsored visas, all of which points to importance of U.S. immigration policies in affecting selectivity
   * policies that favor family reunification increase migration opportunities for populations with larger, more established networks in the United States and limit migration opportunities for groups with fewer numbers of U.S. residents
   * those from South America and the West Indies are less highly selected , with far more entering the United States each year on the basis of family-sponsored preferences
   * a major difference between South American and West Indian black immigrants is in the racial contexts in their regions of origin
   * South American blacks more closely resemble African blacks, a nation with a large African and East Asian presence and very small white population
   * West Indians, in contrast, are considerably more likely to originate from countries that are more racially mixed and/or have greater interaction with whites
   * European-born black immigrants represent the only group that originates from majority white racial contexts
   * selectivity hypothesis: theories of immigrant selectivity would lead us to hypothesize that black immigrants will be healthier than U.S.-born blacks, and that among black immigrants, their health status will vary by region of birth
   * the costs of the journey to the United States are substantially higher from Africa, not simply because of the higher transportation costs, but also because the United States has greater control over immigration flows from Africa, and immigrant networks that can assist with resettlement are less established from African compared to South American, West Indian and European sending areas
   * Results
   * two patterns are immediately apparent
   * the health of U.S.-born blacks is far below that of U.S.-born whites across health measures
   * the “foreign-born” category obscures considerable heterogeneity in black immigrant health
   * looking at self-rated health, for example, U.S.-born blacks are 62 percent more likely to rate their health as “fair or poor” compared to U.S.-born whites, while foreign-born blacks do not appear to differ significantly from the majority white population
   * when broken down by region of birth, we see that African immigrants are healthier than U.S.-born whites; South American and West immigrants do not significantly differ from them; and European immigrants are much less healthy
   * Discussion
   * central claim is that racial context of origin in combination with immigrant selectivity is an important mechanism by which race affects the health status of foreign- and native-born black Americans
   * the results suggest that grouping together foreign-born blacks conceals important differences among this population
   * though awaiting further corroborating evidence, we theorize that the story of the superior health of black immigrants is two-fold
   * the health advantage holds only for those immigrants coming from minority white regions
   * given the work on second generation immigrants this advantage will be difficult to pass on to their children
   * “Americanization” (Landale et al. 1999) may hurt immigrant health – the longer black immigrants are in the United States, the greater their cumulative exposure to stressful life events associated with minority status 
Class Notes (10/3): Black Immigrants 
   * Evidence of Disparities
   * Black-white differences in mortality and morbidity stable despite rapid advances in technology
   * US-born Black Americans
   * shorter life expectancies
   * higher disability rates
   * higher rates of chronic diseases
   * less access to health care 
   * infant mortality rates used to measure health of a country (post-neonatal too)
   * premature birth (PB): less than 37 weeks of gestation
   * low birth weight (LBW): less than 2500 grams (5.5 lbs)
   * if you’re both, prediction of:
   * infant mortality
   * childhood: cognitive/language delay, school failure, psychomotor problems, subnormal growth
   * adulthood: cancer, cardiovascular conditions, diabetes, arthritis
   * LBW predicts adult obesity: nutritionally deprived newborns are programmed to eat more bc develop less neurons in the region of the brain that controls food intake 
   * Explanations for Racial Disparities
   * genetics largely discounted
   * social position
   * buffers against stress
   * discrimination and racism
   * Explanations: Discrimination
   * process by which members of a group are treated differently (unfairly) on the basis of belonging to that group
   * de jure (law) and de facto (reality/culture/practices)
   * impact of discrimination
   * everyday discrimination (David Williams, created scale)
   * Krieger article
   * Why does discrimination matter?
   * experiencing discrimination triggers feelings of being:
   * over-scrutinized
   * overlooked
   * underappreciated
   * misunderstood
   * disrespected
   * violates cultural expectations of fairness, morality, dignity, human rights
   * allostasis: ability to maintain stability through change
   * Importance of Black Immigrants for US Racial Disparities
   * 3% to increased to 9% of US black population, roughly 1 in 5 is an immigrant 
   * Projected to be 16.5% of black population in 2060
   * Why do Black immigrants matter?
   * immigrants from diverse origins
   * 50% Caribbean (Jamaica, Haiti): family preference
   * 39% from Africa: diversity visas
   * immigrants on diverse visas
   * likely translates into diverse health outcomes
   * visa categories matter bc it determines how you immigrate
   * share same racial status as black Americans but experience significantly better health
   * 2nd generation does poorly on many outcomes
   * Mary Water’s research on Caribbean immigrants in NYC
   * more likely to work, work more hours, higher incomes than US born black
   * immigrants come from societies where not the racial minority often w/ accents allow them to be perceived differently
   * over time, advantages erode: without accents and raised in US context, second gen looks identical to US blacks
   * advantages parents bring w/ them wash away in new racial context of origin for their children
   * TLDR: racial context and origin matters to health, experience of being a racial minority or majority 
   * Ways Region of Origin Affects Health
   * exposure to stressful life events (discrimination)
   * position in the stratification system (social position)
   * racial identity formation
   * reference group: for US-born blacks the reference is in the US and for immigrant blacks the reference location is region of origin
   * self-rated health relative to whom?
